# Jaspr - A Web Framework for Dart

Jaspr is a modern web framework for building websites in Dart with support for both client-side and server-side rendering. It is designed to look and feel like Flutter but renders normal HTML and CSS.

> **Note**: This file provides a curated index of the Jaspr documentation to help LLMs understand the framework structure and concepts.

## Getting Started

- [Quick Start](https://docs.jaspr.site/quick_start): How to install Jaspr, create a new project, and run your first website. Covers installation via CLI or VSCode extension, rendering modes, and project structure.
- [Jaspr vs Flutter Web](https://docs.jaspr.site/jaspr-vs-flutter-web): Comparison between Jaspr and Flutter Web, and when to use which.

## Core Concepts

Understanding these core concepts is essential for building applications with Jaspr.

- [Components](https://docs.jaspr.site/concepts/components): Jaspr's component system is similar to Flutter's widgets.
    - `StatelessComponent`: For static UI.
    - `StatefulComponent`: For UI with mutable state.
    - `InheritedComponent`: For propagating data down the tree.
    - Foundational components: `Component.element()`, `Component.text()`, `Component.fragment()`.
- [HTML Structure](https://docs.jaspr.site/concepts/html): How to write HTML using Jaspr components. Using `div()`, `span()`, `h1()`, etc., instead of raw strings.
- [Styling](https://docs.jaspr.site/concepts/styling): Styling websites using CSS-in-Dart (`Styles` class), global stylesheets, or external CSS frameworks like Tailwind or Bulma.
- [Routing](https://docs.jaspr.site/concepts/routing): Handling navigation and URLs.
    - Supports both **multi-page** (server-side) and **single-page** (client-side) routing.
    - Uses `Router` component and `jaspr_router` package.
    - Supports lazy loading for code splitting.
- [Data Fetching](https://docs.jaspr.site/concepts/data_fetching): Strategies for fetching data on the server (during pre-rendering) and synchronizing it with the client.
- [SEO](https://docs.jaspr.site/concepts/seo): Managing document metadata (title, description) for Search Engine Optimization.

## Development & Features

Detailed guides on Jaspr's specific features and development workflows.

- [Rendering Modes](https://docs.jaspr.site/dev/modes):
    - **Static Mode**: Generates static HTML at build time (SSG). Good for content sites.
    - **Server Mode**: Renders pages on demand on the server (SSR). Good for dynamic apps.
    - **Client Mode**: Renders purely on the client (SPA). No pre-rendering.
- [CLI Tool](https://docs.jaspr.site/dev/cli): Using the `jaspr` command-line tool to create (`jaspr create`), serve (`jaspr serve`), and build (`jaspr build`) projects.
- [Server-Side Rendering](https://docs.jaspr.site/dev/server): Deep dive into server-side execution.
    - **Note**: `main.server.dart` is the server entrypoint.
    - Access to request/response context (`context.url`, `context.headers`).
    - Using pure Dart libraries (e.g., `dart:io`).
- [Client-Side Rendering](https://docs.jaspr.site/dev/client): Deep dive into client-side execution (hydration).
    - **Note**: `main.client.dart` is the client entrypoint.
    - **Hydration**: Attaching interactivity to pre-rendered HTML.
    - Use `@client` annotation to mark components for client-side hydration.
    - Accessing DOM and Browser APIs (`package:universal_web`).
- [Static Site Generation](https://docs.jaspr.site/dev/static_sites): Generating static sites with `static` mode. Generating dynamic routes and sitemaps.
- [Deploying](https://docs.jaspr.site/dev/deploying): How to deploy Jaspr apps to different providers (Firebase, GitHub Pages, Docker, Globe).
- [Testing](https://docs.jaspr.site/dev/testing): Testing Jaspr components using `jaspr_test`.
    - `testComponents`: Unit testing.
    - `testClient`: Browser testing.
    - `testServer`: Server-side rendering testing.
- [Configuration](https://docs.jaspr.site/api/config): Configuring Jaspr via `pubspec.yaml` (rendering mode, Flutter embedding, plugins).
- [Linting](https://docs.jaspr.site/api/linting): Using `jaspr_lints` to enforce best practices.
