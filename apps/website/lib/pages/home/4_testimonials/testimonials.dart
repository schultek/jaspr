What impressed me the most is the ability to do everything in Dart instead of JavaScript. The support for hydration, server-side rendering, and built-in Tailwind integration blew me away. I\'ve been using Jaspr since version 0.10.0, and it keeps getting better with every release. The community Kilian built around it is super passionate, and I can\'t wait for it to become the de-facto standard for building web experiences with Dart.',

The SSR support and component-based approach makes it feel like Flutter for the web, but with the flexibility of Dart. It\'s smooth, efficient, and just makes sense. If you\'re into Dart and want to build modern web apps, definitely give Jaspr a try!',
