# Introduction

Welcome to the tutorial for **Jaspr**. This will give you an overview
of how to write Flutter-like native web-apps in pure Dart.

Jaspr *(and this tutorial)* is still in an early phase of development. When you experience any
issue while using the framework, or have a feature request or other feedback I'm happy to receive
issues on [Github](https://github.com/schultek/jaspr).

## What is Jaspr?

[Jaspr] is a modern web framework for building websites in **Dart**, with the premise to look and feel just like Flutter 
while building native web-apps rendering normal html/css like **Vue** or **React**. It is targeted mainly at 
Flutter developers and Dart enthusiasts that want to build native interactive websites. It is made to 
be server-side rendering first but also supports single page applications.

## How to use this tutorial

You'll need to have basic familiarity with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) as well as some **HTML** and CSS knowledge.

As you progress through the tutorial, you'll be presented with mini exercises designed to illustrate 
specific features. Later chapters build on the knowledge gained in earlier ones, so it's recommended 
that you go from start to finish. If necessary, you can navigate via the menu below (hover 'Introduction').

Each tutorial chapter will have a [Show Solution] button that you can click if you get stuck following 
the instructions. Try not to rely on it too much; you will learn faster by figuring out where to put 
each suggested code block and manually typing it in to the editor.
