/// Describes the configuration for an [Element].
///
/// Components are the central class hierarchy in the jaspr framework and have the
/// same structure and purpose as components do in Flutter. A component
/// is an immutable description of part of a user interface. Components can be
/// inflated into elements, which manage the underlying DOM.
///
/// Components themselves have no mutable state (all their fields must be final).
/// If you wish to associate mutable state with a component, consider using a
/// [StatefulComponent], which creates a [State] object (via
/// [StatefulComponent.createState]) whenever it is inflated into an element and
/// incorporated into the tree.
///
/// A given component can be included in the tree zero or more times. In particular
/// a given component can be placed in the tree multiple times. Each time a component
/// is placed in the tree, it is inflated into an [Element], which means a
/// component that is incorporated into the tree multiple times will be inflated
/// multiple times.
///
/// The [key] property controls how one component replaces another component in the
/// tree. If the [runtimeType] and [key] properties of the two components are
/// [operator==], respectively, then the new component replaces the old component by
/// updating the underlying element (i.e., by calling [Element.update] with the
/// new component). Otherwise, the old element is removed from the tree, the new
/// component is inflated into an element, and the new element is inserted into the
/// tree.
///
/// See also:
///
///  * [StatefulComponent] and [State], for components that can build differently
///    several times over their lifetime.
///  * [InheritedComponent], for components that introduce ambient state that can
///    be read by descendant components.
///  * [StatelessComponent], for components that always build the same way given a
///    particular configuration and ambient state.

    //     * Sync non-keyed items with null
