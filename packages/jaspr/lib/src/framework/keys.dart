/// Creating a new GlobalKey on every build will throw away the state of the
/// subtree associated with the old key and create a new fresh subtree for the
/// new key. Besides harming performance, this can also cause unexpected
/// behavior in components in the subtree.
///
/// Instead, a good practice is to let a State object own the GlobalKey, and
