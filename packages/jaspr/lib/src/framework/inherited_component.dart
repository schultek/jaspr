/// Base class for components that efficiently propagate information down the tree.
///
/// To obtain the nearest instance of a particular type of inherited component from
/// a build context, use [BuildContext.dependOnInheritedComponentOfExactType].
///
/// Inherited components, when referenced in this way, will cause the consumer to
/// rebuild when the inherited component itself changes state.
///
/// ## Implementing the `of` method
///
/// The convention is to provide a static method `of` on the [InheritedComponent]
/// which does the call to [BuildContext.dependOnInheritedComponentOfExactType]. This
/// allows the class to define its own fallback logic in case there isn't
/// a component in scope. In the example above, the value returned will be
/// null in that case, but it could also have defaulted to a value.
///
/// Occasionally, the inherited component is an implementation detail of another
/// class, and is therefore private. The `of` method in that case is typically
/// put on the public class instead.
///
/// ## Calling the `of` method
///
/// When using the `of` method, the `context` must be a descendant of the
/// [InheritedComponent], meaning it must be "below" the [InheritedComponent] in the
/// tree.
///
/// See also:
///
///  * [StatefulComponent] and [State], for components that can build differently
///    several times over their lifetime.
///  * [StatelessComponent], for components that always build the same way given a
///    particular configuration and ambient state.
///  * [Component], for an overview of components in general.

  /// inherit from this component but sometimes we do not. For example, if the data
  /// held by this component is the same as the data held by `oldComponent`, then we
  /// do not need to rebuild the components that inherited the data held by
  /// `oldComponent`.
