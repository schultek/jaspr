/// A component that has mutable state.
///
/// State is information that (1) can be read synchronously when the component is
/// built and (2) might change during the lifetime of the component. It is the
/// responsibility of the component implementer to ensure that the [State] is
/// promptly notified when such state changes, using [State.setState].
///
/// A stateful component is a component that describes part of the user interface by
/// building a constellation of other components that describe the user interface
/// more concretely. The building process continues recursively until the
/// description of the user interface is fully concrete (e.g., consists
/// entirely of [DOMComponent]s, which describe concrete DOM elements).
///
/// Stateful components are useful when the part of the user interface you are
/// describing can change dynamically, e.g. due to having an internal
/// clock-driven state, or depending on some system state. For compositions that
/// depend only on the configuration information in the object itself and the
/// [BuildContext] in which the component is inflated, consider using
/// [StatelessComponent].
///
/// [StatefulComponent] instances themselves are immutable and store their mutable
/// state either in separate [State] objects that are created by the
/// [createState] method, or in objects to which that [State] subscribes, for
/// example [Stream] or [ChangeNotifier] objects, to which references are stored
/// in final fields on the [StatefulComponent] itself.
///
/// The framework calls [createState] whenever it inflates a
/// [StatefulComponent], which means that multiple [State] objects might be
/// associated with the same [StatefulComponent] if that component has been inserted
/// into the tree in multiple places. Similarly, if a [StatefulComponent] is
/// removed from the tree and later inserted in to the tree again, the framework
/// will call [createState] again to create a fresh [State] object, simplifying
/// the lifecycle of [State] objects.
///
/// A [StatefulComponent] keeps the same [State] object when moving from one
/// location in the tree to another if its creator used a [GlobalKey] for its
/// [key]. Because a component with a [GlobalKey] can be used in at most one
/// location in the tree, a component that uses a [GlobalKey] has at most one
/// associated element. The framework takes advantage of this property when
/// moving a component with a global key from one location in the tree to another
/// by grafting the (unique) subtree associated with that component from the old
/// location to the new location (instead of recreating the subtree at the new
/// location). The [State] objects associated with [StatefulComponent] are grafted
/// along with the rest of the subtree, which means the [State] object is reused
/// (instead of being recreated) in the new location. However, in order to be
/// eligible for grafting, the component must be inserted into the new location in
/// the same build phase in which it was removed from the old location.
///
/// ## Performance considerations
///
/// There are two primary categories of [StatefulComponent]s.
///
/// The first is one which allocates resources in [State.initState] and disposes
/// of them in [State.dispose], but which does not depend on [InheritedComponent]s
/// or call [State.setState]. Such components are commonly used at the root of an
/// application or page, and communicate with subcomponents via [ChangeNotifier]s,
/// [Stream]s, or other such objects. Stateful components following such a pattern
/// are relatively cheap (in terms of CPU and GPU cycles), because they are
/// built once then never update. They can, therefore, have somewhat complicated
/// and deep build methods.
///
/// The second category is components that use [State.setState] or depend on
/// [InheritedComponent]s. These will typically rebuild many times during the
/// application's lifetime, and it is therefore important to minimize the impact
/// of rebuilding such a component. (They may also use [State.initState] or
/// [State.didChangeDependencies] and allocate resources, but the important part
/// is that they rebuild.)
///
/// There are several techniques one can use to minimize the impact of
/// rebuilding a stateful component:
///
///  * Push the state to the leaves. For example, if your page has a ticking
///    clock, rather than putting the state at the top of the page and
///    rebuilding the entire page each time the clock ticks, create a dedicated
///    clock component that only updates itself.
///
///  * Minimize the number of nodes transitively created by the build method and
///    any components it creates. Ideally, a stateful component would only create a
///    single component, and that component would be a [RenderObjectComponent].
///    (Obviously this isn't always practical, but the closer a component gets to
///    this ideal, the more efficient it will be.)
///
///  * If a subtree does not change, cache the component that represents that
///    subtree and re-use it each time it can be used. It is massively more
///    efficient for a component to be re-used than for a new (but
///    identically-configured) component to be created. Factoring out the stateful
///    part into a component that takes a child argument is a common way of doing
///    this. Another caching strategy consists of assigning a component to a
///    `final` state variable which can be used in the build method.
///
///  * Use `const` components where possible. (This is equivalent to caching a
///    component and re-using it.)
///
///  * When trying to create a reusable piece of UI, prefer using a component
///    rather than a helper method. For example, if there was a function used to
///    build a component, a [State.setState] call would require Flutter to entirely
///    rebuild the returned wrapping component. If a [Component] was used instead,
///    Flutter would be able to efficiently re-render only those parts that
///    really need to be updated. Even better, if the created component is `const`,
///    Flutter would short-circuit most of the rebuild work.
///
///  * Avoid changing the depth of any created subtrees or changing the type of
///    any components in the subtree. For example, rather than returning either the
///    child or the child wrapped in an [IgnorePointer], always wrap the child
///    component in an [IgnorePointer] and control the [IgnorePointer.ignoring]
///    property. This is because changing the depth of the subtree requires
///    rebuilding, laying out, and painting the entire subtree, whereas just
///    changing the property will require the least possible change to the
///    render tree (in the case of [IgnorePointer], for example, no layout or
///    repaint is necessary at all).
///
///  * If the depth must be changed for some reason, consider wrapping the
///    common parts of the subtrees in components that have a [GlobalKey] that
///    remains consistent for the life of the stateful component. (The
///    [KeyedSubtree] component may be useful for this purpose if no other component
///    can conveniently be assigned the key.)
///
/// By convention, component constructors only use named arguments. Also by
/// convention, the first argument is [key], and the last argument is `child`,
/// `children`, or the equivalent.
///

///    particular configuration and ambient state.

///
/// [State] objects have the following lifecycle:
///
///  * The framework creates a [State] object by calling

///  * The newly created [State] object is associated with a [BuildContext].
///    This association is permanent: the [State] object will never change its
///    [BuildContext]. However, the [BuildContext] itself can be moved around
///    the tree along with its subtree. At this point, the [State] object is
///    considered [mounted].
///  * The framework calls [initState]. Subclasses of [State] should override
///    [initState] to perform one-time initialization that depends on the
///    [BuildContext] or the component, which are available as the [context] and
///    [component] properties, respectively, when the [initState] method is
///    called.
///  * The framework calls [didChangeDependencies]. Subclasses of [State] should
///    override [didChangeDependencies] to perform initialization involving
///    [InheritedComponent]s. If [BuildContext.dependOnInheritedComponentOfExactType] is
///    called, the [didChangeDependencies] method will be called again if the
///    inherited components subsequently change or if the component moves in the tree.
///  * At this point, the [State] object is fully initialized and the framework
///    might call its [build] method any number of times to obtain a
///    description of the user interface for this subtree. [State] objects can
///    spontaneously request to rebuild their subtree by callings their
///    [setState] method, which indicates that some of their internal state
///    has changed in a way that might impact the user interface in this
///    subtree.
///  * During this time, a parent component might rebuild and request that this
///    location in the tree update to display a new component with the same
///    [runtimeType] and [Component.key]. When this happens, the framework will
///    update the [component] property to refer to the new component and then call the
///    [didUpdateComponent] method with the previous component as an argument. [State]
///    objects should override [didUpdateComponent] to respond to changes in their
///    associated component (e.g., to start implicit animations). The framework
///    always calls [build] after calling [didUpdateComponent], which means any
///    calls to [setState] in [didUpdateComponent] are redundant.
///  * During development, if a hot reload occurs (whether initiated from the
///    command line `flutter` tool by pressing `r`, or from an IDE), the
///    [reassemble] method is called. This provides an opportunity to
///    reinitialize any data that was prepared in the [initState] method.
///  * If the subtree containing the [State] object is removed from the tree
///    (e.g., because the parent built a component with a different [runtimeType]
///    or [Component.key]), the framework calls the [deactivate] method. Subclasses
///    should override this method to clean up any links between this object
///    and other elements in the tree.
///  * At this point, the framework might reinsert this subtree into another
///    part of the tree. If that happens, the framework will ensure that it
///    calls [build] to give the [State] object a chance to adapt to its new
///    location in the tree. If the framework does reinsert this subtree, it
///    will do so before the end of the build phase in which the subtree was
///    removed from the tree. For this reason, [State] objects can defer
///    releasing most resources until the framework calls their [dispose]
///    method.
///  * If the framework does not reinsert this subtree by the end of the current
///    build phase, the framework will call [dispose], which indicates that
///    this [State] object will never build again. Subclasses should override
///    this method to release any resources retained by this object.
///  * After the framework calls [dispose], the [State] object is considered
///    unmounted and the [mounted] property is false. It is an error to call
///    [setState] at this point. This stage of the lifecycle is terminal: there
///    is no way to remount a [State] object that has been disposed.
