The common use of this attribute is to define the type of stylesheet being referenced (such as text/css), but given that CSS is the only stylesheet language used on the web, not only is it possible to omit the type attribute, but is actually now recommended practice.

/// - [as]: This attribute is only used when rel="preload" or rel="prefetch" has been set on the &lt;link&gt; element.
