/// The &lt;a&gt; HTML element (or anchor element), with its href attribute, creates a hyperlink to web pages, files, email addresses, locations in the same page, or anything else a URL can address.
///
/// Content within each &lt;a&gt; should indicate the link's destination. If the href attribute is present, pressing the enter key while focused on the &lt;a&gt; element will activate it.
///
/// - [download]: Causes the browser to treat the linked URL as a download. Can be used with or without a value:
///
///   Without a value, the browser will suggest a filename/extension, generated from various sources:
///   The Content-Disposition HTTP header
///   The final segment in the URL path
///   The media type (from the Content-Type header, the start of a data: URL, or Blob.type for a blob: URL)
///   Defining a value suggests it as the filename. / and \ characters are converted to underscores (_). Filesystems may forbid other characters in filenames, so browsers will adjust the suggested name if necessary.
/// - [href]: The URL that the hyperlink points to. Links are not restricted to HTTP-based URLs â€” they can use any URL scheme supported by browsers:
///
///   Sections of a page with fragment URLs
///   Pieces of media files with media fragments
///   Telephone numbers with tel: URLs
///   Email addresses with mailto: URLs
///   While web browsers may not support other URL schemes, web sites can with registerProtocolHandler()
/// - [target]: Where to display the linked URL, as the name for a browsing context (a tab, window, or &lt;iframe&gt;).
/// - [type]: Hints at the linked URL's format with a MIME type. No built-in functionality.
/// - [referrerPolicy]: How much of the referrer to send when following the link.
/// - [onClick]: Callback for the 'click' event. This will override the default behavior of the link and not visit [href] when clicked.
