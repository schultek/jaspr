## Issues

### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem, [search if an issue already exists](https://github.com/schultek/jaspr/issues). 
If a related issue doesn't exist, you can [open a new issue](https://github.com/schultek/jaspr/issues/new).

For other contributions like documentation, examples, etc. please also open an issue so we know what you
want to work on and discuss any details.

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/schultek/jaspr/issues) to find one that interests you. 
If you find an issue to work on, first comment on it to express interest in solving it. 
Then you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

## Setup and running

### 1. Cloning and setup

Make sure that you are at least on **Dart SDK version 3.5.0**.

Clone the project with the following command:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/schultek/jaspr.git
```

Jaspr uses [Melos](https://github.com/invertase/melos) to manage the project and dependencies.
To install Melos, run the following command:

```dart
dart pub global activate melos
```

Next, at the root of your locally cloned repository run the bootstrap command:

```dart
melos bootstrap
```

The bootstrap command locally links all dependencies within the project without having to provide manual `dependency_overrides`. 
This allows all packages, examples and tests to build from the local clone project.

> You do not need to run `dart pub get` once bootstrap has been completed.

This also overrides the global `jaspr` command to use the local project, so you have the latest cli version.
Whenever you change something in the `jaspr_cli` package and want to test it using the global `jaspr` command
run `melos activate:cli` to re-activate the package.

### 2. Running tests and compute coverage

To run all tests across packages, run:

```shell
melos run test
```

To also compute the coverage and open the report in your browser, run:

```shell
melos run coverage
```

### 3. Generate html component methods

When you change something in the html component library, re-generate the component
methods by running:

```shell
melos run generate:html
```

### 4. Generate cli scaffold

When you change or add the `jaspr create` scaffold, re-generate the bundle for the cli by running:

```shell
melos run generate:scaffold
```

## Pull Requests & Versioning

Packages inside the /packages directory are versioned using the 
[semantic changelog](https://github.com/rrousselGit/semantic_changelog) approach.

That means that the owner of a pull request is responsible for declaring which package versions should be increased based
on the changes in the pull request. To mark a version change, edit the CHANGELOG.md file of the given package like this:

```markdown
## Unreleased <breaking/major/minor/patch>

/_ insert description about the changes done by this PR _/

## 1.2.3

/_ content of the changelog before this PR _/
```

If there is already a `Unreleased ...` section, simply add your changes to this section.

If you have changes in multiple packages, edit the changelogs of each affected package. Note that the `jaspr`, 
`jaspr_builder`, `jaspr_cli` and `jaspr_test` share a single changelog, so you only have to edit this once.

For a more detailed explanation of this, go to [semantic changelog](https://github.com/rrousselGit/semantic_changelog).
