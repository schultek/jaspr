## 🐶 What is **jaspr**?

**Jaspr** is an modern web framework for building websites in Dart with support for both **client-side** and **server-side rendering**.

- 🔮 **Why?**: Jaspr was made with the premise to make a web-framework that looks and feels just like Flutter, but
  renders normal html/css like Vue or React.
- 👥 **Who?**: Jaspr is targeted mainly at Flutter developers that want to build any type of websites
  (especially ones that are not suitable for Flutter Web).
- 🚀 **What?**: Jaspr wants to push the boundaries of Dart on the web and server, by giving you a thought-through fullstack
  web framework written completely in Dart.

<Info>It is also the name of my puppy ❤️</Info>

## 🍭 Core Features

- 💙 **Familiar**: Works with a similar component model to Flutter widgets.
- 🏗 **Powerful**: Comes with server side rendering out of the box.
- ♻️ **Easy**: Syncs component state between server and client automatically.
- ⚡️ **Fast**: Performs incremental DOM updates only where needed.
- 🎛 **Flexible**: Runs on the server, client or both with manual or automatic setup. You decide.

> If you want to say thank you, star the project on GitHub and like the package on pub.dev 🙌💙

## 🎡 Online Editor & Playground

Inspired by DartPad, **Jaspr** has its own online editor and playground, called **JasprPad**.

[Check it out here!](https://jasprpad.schultek.de)

You can check out the samples, take the tutorial or try out jaspr for yourself, all live in the browser.
When you want to continue coding offline, you can quickly download the current files bundled in a complete dart project, ready to start coding locally.

JasprPad is also built with **Jaspr** itself, so you can [**check out its source code**](https://github.com/schultek/jaspr/tree/main/apps/jaspr_pad) to get a feel for how jaspr would be used in a larger app.
