This guide explores some **advanced customization** options for `jaspr_content`. You'll learn how to use **page extensions** to dynamically add to or modify parts of your content, implement **custom components**, **create layouts** for a consistent look, or **apply theming** for a personalized appearance.

## Page Extensions

Extensions enhance the rendering of your content by adding features or modifying the output. They can **transform content**, add capabilities, or generate additional data during the rendering process.

Page extensions are applied after the parsing of your content but before any rendering. They operate on a tree of `Nodes`, which represent the parsed content in a structured way. 

<Info>
Read more about `Nodes` and how they are structured in the [Page Extensions](/content/concepts/page_extensions) docs.
</Info>

Extensions have full control over the tree and can modify it in any way, enabling lots of different use-cases. `jaspr_content` comes with two convenient extensions out of the box:

- [`HeadingAnchorsExtension`](/content/extensions/heading_anchors): Generates anchor links for all headings in the content and adds them as clickable '#' symbols to the headings.

- [`TableOfContentsExtension`](/content/extensions/table_of_contents): Generates a table of contents for your pages based on the headings in the content.

Additionally, you can also add your own extensions by implementing the `PageExtension` class like this:

```dart
class MyExtension implements PageExtension {

  @override
  List<Node> apply(Page page, List<Node> nodes) {
    // Implement your extension logic here
  }
}
```

There is lots you can do with custom extensions, for example:

- Customize standard elements like paragraphs, headings, blockquotes, images etc.
- Analyze the structure of your content to generate thinks like table of contents, references, glossary etc.
- Add new dynamic elements to the content.
- *Whatever else you come up with*

---

Apart from extensions, you can also use **Custom Components** to achieve some of these things in a different way, which is discussed in the next section.

## Components

In the previous [Writing Content](/content/guides/writing_content) guide, we introduced the basics of using custom components in your content. Now let's dive deeper into customizing and creating your own components.

### Using Jaspr Components

You can make any normal Jaspr component available in your content using the html-like `<Component>` syntax. 

Say you have written a `class Card extends StatelessComponent` class that takes a `String? title` and `Component child`, you can add it to your page configuration like this:

```dart
ContentApp(
  ...
  components: [
    CustomComponent(
      pattern: 'Card',
      builder: (name, attributes, child) {
        return Card(title: attributes['title'], child: child!);
      }
    )
  ]
)
```

Then you can write markdown like this to render your card component:

```markdown
<Card>Simple card with no title.</Card>

<Card title="My Single Card">Simple card with title.</Card>

<Card title="My Markdown Card">
  Card that contains **markdown content**.

  > You can even nest components like this:

  <Card>Nested card</Card>
</Card>
```

### Overriding Standard Elements

Components can also override standard markdown elements. For example when using the [`CodeBlock`](/content/components/code_block) component, any standard markdown codeblock will be rendered as this component. This is used to add additional features to codeblocks, like syntax highlighting and a copy button.

To add similar functionality to your own custom components, instead of using the `CustomComponent()` constructor, create a class implementing `CustomComponent` like this:

```dart
class CustomCard implements CustomComponent {

  @override
  Component? create(Node node, NodesBuilder builder) {
    ...
  }
}
```

Here instead of using a `pattern`, you must implement the `create` method to detect and build your component. It will be called for each parsed `Node` from the content and should return either a `Component` to override this node or `null` otherwise.

<Info>
For more information on what a `Node` is and how to use it, check out the [Page Parsing](/content/concepts/page_parsing) docs.
</Info>

For example, to override the standard `blockquote` markdown syntax, write the following:

```dart
@override
Component? create(Node node, NodesBuilder builder) {
  if (node case ElementNode(tag: 'blockquote', :List<Node>? children)) {
    return Card(child: builder.build(children));
  }
  return null;
}
```

<Info>
You can also use this in combination with custom markdown syntaxes. Checkout the [Markdown Parsing](/content/concepts/page_parsing#markdown) docs for more info.

## Layouts

So far we only covered how to customize the main content of a page. However a website usually consists of other parts as well, like headers, footers, sidebars or other ui before or after the content. This is where [PageLayouts](/content/concepts/page_layouts) come into play.

Layouts define the structure of your pages and provide a consistent look and feel across your site. They can include headers, footers, sidebars, and other ui around your content. You can choose one of the **built-in layouts** or **create your own**.

### Built-in Layouts

Jaspr comes with two built-in layouts:

- [DocsLayout](/content/layouts/docs_layout): A beautiful documentation layout with a sidebar, header and table of contents.
- [BlogLayout](/content/layouts/blog_layout): A clean and minimal blog layout with a header and title block.

To use a layout, simply add it to the page configuration like this:

```dart
ContentApp(
  ...
  layouts: [
    DocsLayout(
      ...
    )
  ]
);
```

Both layouts have additional properties to configure their appearance.

## Create Custom Layouts

You can create your own layouts by implementing the `PageLayout` interface or by extending the `PageLayoutBase` class. This allows for full control over the structure and appearance of your pages.

A custom layout typically involves:
1.  Defining a unique `name` (pattern) to be used in frontmatter.
2.  Optionally overriding `buildHead` to add custom meta tags, styles, or scripts.
3.  Implementing `buildBody` to structure the page, incorporating the main `child` content alongside custom elements like headers, footers, or sidebars.

```dart title="lib/my_custom_layout.dart"
import 'package:jaspr/jaspr.dart';
import 'package:jaspr_content/jaspr_content.dart';

class MyCustomLayout extends PageLayoutBase {
  const MyCustomLayout();

  @override
  Pattern get name => 'my_custom_layout_name'; // To be used in frontmatter.

  @override
  Iterable<Component> buildHead(Page page) sync* {
    yield* super.buildHead(page); // Add common meta tags.
    // Add custom styles or scripts here
  }

  @override
  Component buildBody(Page page, Component child) {
    return div(classes: 'custom_layout', [
      // Add a custom header, nav, etc.
      main_([child]), // Main content
      // Add a custom footer
    ]);
  }
}
```

Then, register your custom layout in your `ContentApp` configuration:

```dart
ContentApp(
  // ...
  layouts: [
    MyCustomLayout(),
    // other layouts
  ],
)
```

<Info>
For a more detailed guide on creating custom layouts, including how to add a table of contents and use layout components, refer to the [Page Layouts](/content/concepts/page_layouts) documentation.

## Theming

Theming allows you to customize the colors, typography, and overall look of your site.

### Content Theme

The `ContentTheme` class provides a way to define colors and other visual properties:

```dart
ContentApp(
  theme: ContentTheme(
    // Primary color for buttons, links, etc.
    primary: ThemeColor(Color('#01589B'), dark: Color('#41C3FE')),
    
    // Background color for the site
    background: ThemeColor(Colors.white, dark: Color('#0b0d0e')),
    
    // Text colors
    text: ThemeColor(Colors.black, dark: Colors.white),
    textMuted: ThemeColor(Colors.grey[700], dark: Colors.grey[300]),
    
    // Font settings
    fontFamily: 'Inter, system-ui, sans-serif',
    codeFont: 'JetBrains Mono, monospace',
  ),
)
```

The `ThemeColor` class allows you to specify different colors for light and dark modes, which work with the built-in theme toggle.

### Custom CSS

You can also add custom CSS to your site by including a stylesheet:

```dart
ContentApp(
  extraStylesheets: [
    'assets/custom-styles.css',
  ],
)
```

### Responsive Design

All built-in layouts are responsive by default, but you can customize how they behave at different screen sizes:

```dart
DocsLayout(
  // ...
  responsiveBreakpoint: 768, // px
  sidebarPosition: SidebarPosition.left,
  sidebarWidth: 250, // px
)
```

## Putting It All Together

Here's a complete example that brings together all the customization options:

```dart
// lib/main.dart
import 'package:jaspr/server.dart';
import 'package:jaspr_content/jaspr_content.dart';

void main() {
  Jaspr.initializeApp();

  runApp(ContentApp.custom(
    loaders: [
      FilesystemLoader('content'),
      GithubLoader(
        'username/repo',
        accessToken: '...',
      ),
    ],
    configResolver: PageConfig.resolve(
      dataLoaders: [
        FilesystemDataLoader('content/_data'),
      ],
      templateEngine: MustacheTemplateEngine(),
      parsers: [
        HtmlParser(),
        MarkdownParser(),
      ],
      extensions: [
        TableOfContentsExtension(),
        HeadingAnchorsExtension(),
        ComponentsExtension([
          Callout.factory,
        ]),
      ],
      layouts: [
        DocsLayout(
          favicon: 'favicon.ico',
          header: Header(
            title: 'Jaspr',
            logo: 'assets/logo.png',
            items: [
              ThemeToggle(),
              GithubButton(repo: 'username/repo'),
            ]
          ),
          sidebar: Sidebar(groups: [
            SidebarGroup(
              links: [
                SidebarLink(text: "📖 Overview", href: '/'),
                SidebarLink(text: "🥊 About", href: '/about'),
              ],
            ),
            SidebarGroup(title: 'Get Started', links: [
              SidebarLink(text: "🖟 Rendering Modes", href: '/get_started/modes'),
              SidebarLink(text: "💧 Server vs Client", href: '/get_started/server_client'),
            ]),
          ]),
        ),
      ],
      theme: ContentTheme(
        primary: ThemeColor(Color('#01589B'), dark: Color('#41C3FE')),
        background: ThemeColor(Colors.white, dark: Color('#0b0d0e')),
      ),
    ),
  ));
}
```

This configuration creates a comprehensive content site with:

- Content loaded from both the local filesystem and a GitHub repository
- Frontmatter data in all files with additional data from JSON/YAML files
- Content parsed from markdown and HTML files
- A table of contents automatically generated from headings
- Anchor links for each heading for easy linking
- Custom components like callout boxes
- A documentation layout with header, theme toggle, GitHub button, and sidebar navigation
- Custom primary and background colors with light and dark variants

By combining these customization options, you can create a unique and feature-rich content site that matches your brand and meets your specific requirements.
