description: Create custom components to use in your content.

---

With custom components you can use any normal Jaspr component in your content files. 

This enables you to enhance your content with more visual or interactive experiences for your visitors over what is possible with only Markdown.

## Using Components

To include components in your content, you can use the html-like `<Component>` syntax. For example, the `<Info>` component can be used to display an informational message more visible to users:

```markdown
<Info>This draws attention to useful page information.</Info>
```

The inner content of a component can contain normal markdown or even other components, which will be rendered as its children. Additionally, components can also take attributes to further customize their behavior: 

```markdown
<Tabs>
  <TabItem name="Tab 1" value="1">
    **First Item**
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem name="Tab 2" value="2">
    *Second Item*
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

## Adding Components

To make a custom component available for use in your content, add it to the `components` list of `ContentApp` or `PageConfig`:

```dart
ContentApp(
  ...
  components: [
    Callout(),
    Tabs(),
  ],
);
```

The `Callout` and `Tabs` components are provided by `jaspr_content` itself. But you can also easily add your own Jaspr component by wrapping it in a `CustomComponent` object.

## Creating Custom Components

Say you have a normal Jaspr component like this:

```dart
class Card extends StatelessComponent {
  const Card({this.title, this.child, super.key});

  final String? title;
  final Component? child;

  ...
}
```

To make this available as a custom `<Card>` component in your content, add the following to your app:

```dart
ContentApp(
  ...
  components: [
    CustomComponent(
      pattern: 'Card',
      builder: (name, attributes, child) {
        return Card(title: attributes['title'], child: child);
      }
    ),
  ],
);
```

Then you can write markdown like this to render your card component:

```markdown
<Card>Simple card with no title.</Card>

<Card title="My Single Card">Simple card with title.</Card>

<Card title="My Markdown Card">
  Card that contains **markdown content**.

  > You can even nest components like this:

  <Card>Nested card</Card>
</Card>
```

---

The `CustomComponent` constructor takes the following parameters:

<Property name="pattern" type="Pattern" required>
  A `String` or `RegExp` that matches the component name in your content.
</Property>

---

<Property name="builder" type="Component Function(...)" required>
  A builder function that builds the Jaspr component.
  
  It receives the following parameters:
  
  <Card>
    <Property name="name" type="String">
      The component name matched by `pattern`. 
    </Property>
    
    ---

    <Property name="attributes" type="Map<String, String>">
      The parsed attributes.
    </Property>

    ---

    <Property name="child" type="Component?">
      The inner content of the component. 
      This is `null` when using the self-closing `<Component />` syntax.
    </Property>
    
   </Card>
</Property>

### Syntax Overrides

Some of `jaspr_content`s provided components like [`CodeBlock`](/content/components/code_block) and [`Image`](/content/components/image) override their respective standard markdown syntax in addition to the `<Component>` syntax. For example when using the `CodeBlock` component, any standard markdown codeblock will be rendered as this component.

To add similar functionality to your own custom components, instead of using the `CustomComponent()` constructor, create a class implementing `CustomComponent` like this:

```dart
class CustomCard implements CustomComponent {

  @override
  Component? create(Node node, NodesBuilder builder) {
    ...
  }
}
```

Here instead of using a `pattern`, you must implement the `create` method to detect and build your component. It will be called for each parsed `Node` from the content and should return either a `Component` to override this node or `null` otherwise.

<Info>
For more information on what a `Node` is and how to use it, check out the [Page Parsing](/content/concepts/page_parsing) docs.

For example, to override the standard `blockquote` markdown syntax, write the following:

```dart
@override
Component? create(Node node, NodesBuilder builder) {
  if (node case ElementNode(tag: 'blockquote', :List<Node>? children)) {
    return Card(child: builder.build(children));
  }
  return null;
}
```

<Info>
You can also use this in combination with custom markdown syntaxes. Checkout the [Markdown Parsing](/content/concepts/page_parsing#markdown) docs for more info.
