description: Create custom components to use in your content.

---

With custom components you can use any normal **Jaspr Component** in your content files. This enables you to enhance your content with more visual or interactive experiences for your visitors over what is possible with only Markdown.

## Using Components

To include components in your content, you can use the html-like `<Component>` syntax. For example, the `<Info>` component can be used to display an informational message more visible to users:

```markdown
<Info>This draws attention to useful page information.</Info>
```

The inner content of a component can contain normal markdown or even other components, which will be rendered as its children. Additionally, components can also take attributes to further customize their behavior: 

```markdown
<Tabs>
  <TabItem name="Tab 1" value="1">
    **First Item**
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem name="Tab 2" value="2">
    *Second Item*
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

## Adding Components

To make a custom component available for use in your content, add it to the `components` list of `ContentApp` or `PageConfig`:

```dart
ContentApp(
  ...
  components: [
    Callout(),
    Tabs(),
  ],
);
```

The `Callout` and `Tabs` components are provided by `jaspr_content` itself. But you can also easily add your own Jaspr component by wrapping it in a `CustomComponent` object.

## Creating Custom Components

Say you have a normal Jaspr component like this:

```dart
class Card extends StatelessComponent {
  const Card({this.title, required this.child, super.key});

  final String? title;
  final Component child;

  ...
}
```

To make this available as a custom `<Card>` component in your content, add the following to your app:

```dart
ContentApp(
  ...
  components: [
    CustomComponent(
      pattern: 'Card',
      builder: (name, attributes, child) {
        return Card(title: attributes['title'], child: child!);
      }
    ),
  ],
);
```

Then you can write markdown like this to render your card component:

```markdown
<Card>Simple card with no title.</Card>

<Card title="My Single Card">Simple card with title.</Card>

<Card title="My Markdown Card">
  Card that contains **markdown content**.

  > You can even nest components like this:

  <Card>Nested card</Card>
</Card>
```

---

The `CustomComponent` constructor takes the following parameters:

<Property name="pattern" type="Pattern" required>
  A `String` or `RegExp` that matches the component name in your content.
</Property>

---

<Property name="builder" type="Component Function(...)" required>
  A builder function that builds the Jaspr component.
  
  It receives the following parameters:
  
  <Card>
    <Property name="name" type="String">
      The component name matched by `pattern`. 
    </Property>
    
    ---

    <Property name="attributes" type="Map<String, String>">
      The parsed attributes.
    </Property>

    ---

    <Property name="child" type="Component?">
      The inner content of the component. 
      This is `null` when using the self-closing `<Component />` syntax.
    </Property>
    
   </Card>
</Property>

### Standard Element Overrides

Some of `jaspr_content`s provided components like [`CodeBlock`](/content/components/code_block) and [`Image`](/content/components/image) override their respective standard markdown elements in addition to the `<Component>` syntax. For example when using the `CodeBlock` component, any standard markdown codeblock will be rendered as this component.

To add similar functionality to your own custom components, instead of using the `CustomComponent()` constructor, create a class implementing `CustomComponent` like this:

```dart
class CustomCard implements CustomComponent {

  @override
  Component? create(Node node, NodesBuilder builder) {
    ...
  }
}
```

Here instead of using a `pattern`, you must implement the `create` method to detect and build your component. It will be called for each parsed `Node` from the content and should return either a `Component` to override this node or `null` otherwise.

<Info>
For more information on what a `Node` is and how to use it, check out the [Page Parsing](/content/concepts/page_parsing) docs.

For example, to override the standard `blockquote` markdown syntax, write the following:

```dart
@override
Component? create(Node node, NodesBuilder builder) {
  if (node case ElementNode(tag: 'blockquote', :List<Node>? children)) {
    return Card(child: builder.build(children));
  }
  return null;
}
```

<Info>
You can also use this in combination with custom markdown syntaxes. Checkout the [Markdown Parsing](/content/concepts/page_parsing#markdown) docs for more info.
