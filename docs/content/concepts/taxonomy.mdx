Taxonomies let you classify content using frontmatter fields like **tags** or **categories**. A taxonomy is a classification system where each unique value is called a **term**. For example, a "tags" taxonomy might have the terms "dart", "flutter", and "jaspr".

The `TaxonomyLoader` scans your content files, extracts all unique terms from a frontmatter field, and generates pages for each one. Combined with the `TaxonomyContext` extension, you can query taxonomy data from within component builders.

## How It Works

Given blog posts with a `tags` field in their frontmatter:

```markdown title="content/posts/hello-world.md"
---
title: Hello World
tags: [Dart, Flutter]
---

Welcome to my blog!
```

```markdown title="content/posts/building-with-jaspr.md"
---
title: Building with Jaspr
tags: [Dart, Jaspr]
---

Let's build something!
```

The `TaxonomyLoader` will:

1. Scan the content directory for files with frontmatter.
2. Extract unique values from the `tags` field: "Dart", "Flutter", "Jaspr".
3. Normalize them to lowercase with dashes: `dart`, `flutter`, `jaspr`.
4. Generate a page for each term at `/tags/dart`, `/tags/flutter`, `/tags/jaspr`.
5. Optionally generate a taxonomy index page at `/tags/`.

Each generated page carries metadata identifying its taxonomy and term, which the context extensions use for querying.

## Term Normalization

All terms are normalized before use. The normalization converts values to lowercase and replaces spaces with dashes:

- `"Dart"` → `dart`
- `"My Tag"` → `my-tag`
- `"Hello World"` → `hello-world`

This means `tags: [Dart]` and `tags: [dart]` in different files refer to the same term.

## Multiple Taxonomies

You can use multiple `TaxonomyLoader`s for different classification systems:

```dart
ContentApp.custom(
  eagerlyLoadAllPages: true,
  loaders: [
    FilesystemLoader('content'),
    TaxonomyLoader(
      taxonomy: 'tags',
      termPageBuilder: (context, taxonomy, term) { /* ... */ },
    ),
    TaxonomyLoader(
      taxonomy: 'categories',
      termPageBuilder: (context, taxonomy, term) { /* ... */ },
    ),
  ],
  // ...
);
```

Each taxonomy operates independently — terms from one taxonomy do not interfere with another.
