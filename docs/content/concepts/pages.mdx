Pages are the core of any content-driven site. They represent a single piece of content that can be requested through its url.

For example, you might have a `about.md` file that is rendered as a page at the `/about` url. 

## Rendering Pipeline

In `jaspr_content` pages are built based on the configuration provided to the `ContentApp` component. This configuration defines how the content is loaded, parsed, and rendered.

For a single page, the following steps are taken:

1. The page is created by one of the provided `RouteLoader`s.
2. The page's configuration is resolved by the provided `ConfigResolver` based on its route.
3. The page's frontmatter is parsed and additional data is loaded by the configured `DataLoader`s.
4. The page's content is pre-processed by the configured `TemplateEngine`.
5. The page's content is parsed by one of the configured `PageParser`s.
6. The parsed content is further processed by the configured `PageExtension`s.
7. The processed content is rendered using the configured `CustomComponent`s and wrapped in a `Content` component.
8. The content component is wrapped in a `PageLayout` and gets applied the configured `ContentTheme`.
9. The result is rendered to HTML.

All of the different parts used to build a page are configurable. They can be switched out, extended, or replaced with custom implementations. This allows you to create a content-driven site that fits your needs perfectly.

## Page

The `Page` class is the main data object that holds all information about a single page.

<Card title="Fields" icon="file">
  <Property name="path" type="String">
    The path of the page including its suffix, e.g. 'index.html', 'some/path.md'.
  </Property>

  ---

  <Property name="url" type="String">
    The url of the page, e.g. '/', '/some/path'.
  </Property>

  ---

  <Property name="content" type="String">
    The (unparsed) content of the page.

    This may be modified by the different modules during the page building process.
  </Property>

  ---

  <Property name="data" type="Map<String, dynamic>">
    Additional data for the page.

    This contains data from the frontmatter, data loaders, and any other data that is added to the page during the building process.

    This may be modified by the different modules during the page building process.
  </Property>

  ---

  <Property name="config" type="PageConfig">
    The configuration for the page. 

    This determines how the page is built.
  </Property>
</Card>

Each part in the pipeline can modify the page's content or data by using the `apply()` method like this:

```dart
page.apply(
  content: 'updated content',
  data: {'key': 'value'},
);
```

With this the content is overridden and the data is deeply merged with the existing data, unless `mergeData` is set to `false`.

### Accessing a Page

For most parts of the pipeline, you will have access to the page object directly. E.g. a `DataLoader` will receive the current page as an argument in its `loadData(Page page)` method.

You can also access the current page from within any Jaspr component by using the `context.page` extension getter:

```dart
class MyComponent extends StatelessComponent {
  @override
  Component build(BuildContext context) {
    return text('Page URL: ${context.page.url}');
  }
}
```

## PageConfig

The `PageConfig` class is the main configuration object for a page. It holds all the settings for loading, parsing, and rendering the page.

<Card title="Properties" icon="sliders">
  <Property name="enableFrontmatter" type="bool">
    Whether to enable frontmatter parsing. Defaults to `true`.
  </Property>

  ---

  <Property name="dataLoaders" type="List<DataLoader>">
    The data loaders to use for loading additional data for the page.
  </Property>

  ---

  <Property name="templateEngine" type="TemplateEngine">
    The template engine to use for preprocessing the page content before parsing.
  </Property>

  ---

  <Property name="rawOutputPattern" type="Pattern">
    A pattern to match pages that should output their raw content.
    When this matches a page's path, this will skip parsing and rendering the page and return the content as is.
    This may be used for matching non-html pages like robots.txt, sitemap.xml, etc.
  </Property>

  ---

  <Property name="secondaryOutputs" type="List<SecondaryOutput>">
    A collection of secondary outputs to create for matching pages.
    When an output matches a page's path, it is used to generate additional files for the page.
    This may be used for outputting supplementary files like a 'index.html.md' file containing the raw markdown of a page.
  </Property>

  ---

  <Property name="parsers" type="List<PageParser>">
    The parsers to use for parsing the page content.
    Each parser may be responsible for a file type like markdown, html, etc.
  </Property>

  ---

  <Property name="extensions" type="List<PageExtension>">
    The extensions to use for processing the parsed page nodes.
    Each extension may add or modify the nodes of the page.
    Extensions are applied in the order they are listed.
  </Property>

  ---

  <Property name="components" type="List<CustomComponent>">
    A collection of custom components to render in the page.
  </Property>

  ---

  <Property name="layouts" type="List<PageLayout>">
    The layouts to use for building the page.
    When more than one layout is provided, the layout to use is determined by the 'layout' key in the page data.
    Therefore a page can choose its layout by setting 'layout: ___' in its frontmatter.
    When no key is set or matching, the first provided layout is used.
  </Property>
  
  ---

  <Property name="theme" type="ContentTheme">
    The theme to use for the page.
  </Property>
</Card>

There are two ways to create a `PageConfig`:

- The `ContentApp()` constructor creates a single `PageConfig` that is used for all pages. 

- Alternatively the `ContentApp.custom()` constructor takes a `ConfigResolver` function that can return different `PageConfig`s for different pages. This allows you to have different configurations for different parts of your site. In addition to writing a custom function, you can:

  - use `PageConfig.all(...)` to create a `ConfigResolver` that resolves the same `PageConfig` for all pages.
  - use `PageConfig.match(Map<Pattern, PageConfig>)` to resolve a `PageConfig` based on the page's path.
