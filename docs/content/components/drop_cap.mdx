## Usage

To use the `<DropCap>` component, add it to your `components` list in your `main.dart` file:

```dart
import 'package:jaspr_content/components/drop_cap.dart';

// ...

ContentApp(
  components: [
    DropCap(),
  ],
)
```

Then put the `<DropCap/>` component immediately before the paragraph you want to apply it to:

```markdown
<DropCap/>
The first letter of this paragraph (T) will be a drop cap. ...
```
