The Tabs component allows you to organize content into different sections that can be switched between by the user. This is useful for displaying related information in a compact and user-friendly way.

## Usage

To use the `Tabs` component, you first need to add it to the `components` list of your `ContentApp`:

```dart
import 'package:jaspr_content/components/tabs.dart';

// ...

ContentApp(
  components: [
    Tabs(),
  ],
)
```

Then, you can use the `<Tabs>` and `<TabItem>` components in your content files:

```jsx
<Tabs defaultValue="item2">
  <TabItem label="Tab 1" value="item1">
    This is the content for the first tab.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Tab 2" value="item2">
    This is the content for the second tab.
    
    You can include other components and **markdown** inside a `TabItem`.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Tab 3" value="item3">
    This is the content for the third tab.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

This will render a set of tabs where users can click on "Tab 1", "Tab 2", or "Tab 3" to view their respective content. In this example, "Tab 2" will be selected by default.

### Tabs Properties

The `<Tabs>` component serves as a container for `TabItem`s and has the following attribute:

<Property name="defaultValue" type="String">
  The `value` of the `TabItem` that should be selected by default when the tabs are first rendered. If not provided, the first `TabItem` will be selected.
</Property>

---

### TabItem Properties

The `<TabItem>` component defines an individual tab and its content. It has the following attributes:

<Property name="label" type="String" required>
  The text that will be displayed on the tab itself.
</Property>

---

<Property name="value" type="String" required>
  A unique identifier for this tab. This value is used by the `defaultValue` attribute of the parent `<Tabs>` component to specify which tab to select initially.
</Property>

---

The content nested inside a `<TabItem>` tag will be displayed when that tab is active. You can include any valid markdown or other custom components within a `<TabItem>`.
