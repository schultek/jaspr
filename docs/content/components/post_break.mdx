## Usage

To use the `<PostBreak>` component, add it to your `components` list in your `main.dart` file:

```dart
import 'package:jaspr_content/components/post_break.dart';

// ...

ContentApp(
  components: [
    PostBreak(),
  ],
)
```

Then put the `<PostBreak/>` component somewhere in your markdown content:

```markdown
This is a paragraph.

<PostBreak/>

This is another, longer paragraph. ...
```
