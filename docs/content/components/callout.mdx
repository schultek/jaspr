---

Use one of the callout variants to draw attention to important information on your page, such as a success, warning, information or error message.

## Usage

Add the `Callout()` component to your `components` list in your `main.dart` file:

```dart
import 'package:jaspr_content/components/callout.dart';

// ...

ContentApp(
  components: [
    Callout(),
  ],
)
```

Then use the callout variants (`<Info`, `<Warning>`, `<Error>`, `<Success>`) in your content files to display the callout boxes.
