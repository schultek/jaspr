description: Syncing the state of a StatefulComponent from server to client.

Alongside with preloading some data on the server, you often want to also sync the data with the client.
The `SyncStateMixin` lets you sync state of a StatefulComponent from the server with the client.

<Info>
For a general guide about data-fetching on the server see [Data Fetching](/concepts/data_fetching).
</Info>

## Usage

The `SyncStateMixin` accepts a second type argument for the data type that you want to sync. You then have to
implement the `getState()` and `updateState()` methods.

```dart
class MyState extends State<MyStatefulComponent> with SyncStateMixin<MyStatefulComponent, String> {

  String myData = "Hello World";

  // This will get the state to be sent to the client
  // and is only executed on the server.
  @override
  String getState() {
    return myData;
  }

  // This will receive the state on the client and is
  // executed during [initState].
  void updateState(String value) {
    myData = value;
  }
}
```

In order to send the data, it needs to be serialized on the server and deserialized on the client.
Therefore, the synced state must have a **primitive serializable type**, like `String`, `int`, `double`, `bool` or `Map`s or `List`s of these.

If you want to sync non-primitive values like custom data classes, you need to handle encoding and decoding
manually in the `getState()` and `updateState()` methods respectively.

## Alternatives

- Check out the [@sync](/utils/at_sync) annotation for an even easier way to sync state of a `StatefulComponent` between
server and client, including support for custom data types.

- Check out [@client](/utils/at_client) components, that support passing data from the server to the client as part
of the component parameters, including support for custom data types.
