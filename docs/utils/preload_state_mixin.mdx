# PreloadStateMixin
*Asynchronously preloading the state of a StatefulComponent on the server.*

---

The `PreloadStateMixin` lets you asynchronously load the state of a StatefulComponent before it is rendered on the server
during pre-rendering.

<Info>
For a general guide about data-fetching on the server see [Data Fetching](/concepts/data_fetching).
</Info>

## Usage

Start by adding the `PreloadStateMixin` on a `StatefulComponent`s `State` class and implement the `Future<T> preloadState()` method.

```dart
class MyState extends State<MyStatefulComponent> with PreloadStateMixin {

  @override
  Future<void> preloadState() async {
    ...
  }
}
```

This method will only be executed on the server and will be called before `initState()`. It will defer
`initState()` as well as building the component until the future returned by the method is completed.

## Alternatives

If you are in a purely server-rendered component, you should also check out the
[AsyncStatelessComponent or AsyncBuilder](/components/async_component) components.
