## New Component Scopes

The latest version of the VSCode extension contains a big quality-of-life feature to help navigate the complexities of writing full-stack components: **Component Scopes**.

For each of your components, you will now get a small hint directly in the editor whether that component is rendered on the server and/or on the client. This helps with reasoning which sdk libraries are available and which APIs can be used. Before, this would only show up as compilation errors during build.

The editor hints for a fullstack component look like this:

You can click on either server and client hint to see the root(s) of the respective scope, which for the server scope is always the `main()` method of the server entrypoint, and for the client scope is one or more `@client` components.

Scope hints can optionally be disabled in the settings.

### Tooling Daemon

This feature is built upon a new **Jaspr Tooling Daemon** that runs in the background when using Jaspr.

This sets the foundation for more tooling related features in the future and is IDE independent, making it possible for others to create plugins for other IDEs. *If you are interested, lmk on discord and I'm happy to support.*
