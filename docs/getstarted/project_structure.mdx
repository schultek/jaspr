# Project Structure
### The structure of a new Jaspr project.

---

Depending on your chosen [**Rendering Mode** and **Hydration**](/core/modes) setting, your Jaspr project will have the following project structure:

<Tabs defaultValue="sa" values={[
    {label: 'static/server - automatic', value: 'sa'},
    {label: 'static/server - manual', value: 'sm'},
    {label: 'client', value: 'c'}
]}
>
    <TabItem value="sa">

        ```markdown
        ├── lib/
        │   ├── components/
        │   │   ├── counter.dart
        │   │   └── ...
        │   ├── pages/
        │   │   ├── home.dart
        │   │   └── ...
        │   ├── app.dart
        │   ├── ...
        │   ├── jaspr_options.dart
        │   └── main.dart
        ├── web/
        │   └── images/
        │       └── ...
        ├── pubspec.lock
        └── pubspec.yaml
        ```

        - The `lib` directory contains all your usual dart code, including components, pages, routes etc.
        depending on your architecture.

        - The `lib/main.dart` file is the entry point for your **server** application. It calls `runApp()`
        and provides your root document component.

        Any component annotated with `@client` that is built during pre-rendering will automatically be hydrated on the client.

        - The optional `lib/jaspr_options.dart` is auto-generated by Jasprs tooling. It exposes a top-level `defaultJasprOptions`
        that you should provide to the `Jaspr.initializeApp(options: ...)` call inside `lib/main.dart`.

        - The `web` directory contains any static assets you want to access from your website, like images or fonts.
        Files inside this directory are later accessible through their relative url, e.g. `<domain>/images/logo.png`.

        Additionally any `.dart` file in here will be compiled to js and accessible through `<domain>/<filename>.dart.js`.

            - The `web/main.dart` file is the **client** entry point for your application. It calls `runApp()` and provides
            the main app component, hydrating the pre-rendered html created by the server.

            - The `web/index.html` file (along with other html and css files) contains the static markup and styling for your website.

            - The `web/main.dart` file is the entry point for your application. It calls `runApp()` and provides
            the main app component.
