<Warning>
Requires Flutter 3.24.0 or newer.
</Warning>

To embed a Flutter app into your Jaspr website you need the following setup:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Add `flutter` and `jaspr_flutter_embed` as dependencies:
    
    ```shell
    dart pub add flutter jaspr_flutter_embed
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Replace `build_web_compilers` with `jaspr_web_compilers` as a dev dependency:

    ```shell
    dart pub remove build_web_compilers
    dart pub add jaspr_web_compilers --dev
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Create the file `web/flutter_bootstrap.js` with the following content:

    ```js
    {{flutter_js}}
    {{flutter_build_config}}
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Add the `FlutterEmbedView` component to your jaspr app like this:

    ```dart
    import 'package:jaspr_flutter_embed/jaspr_flutter_embed.dart';

    // import your flutter app widget
    import 'my_flutter_app.dart';

    // this can be any jaspr component
    class JasprApp extends StatelessComponent {
      JasprApp({super.key});

      Iterable<Component> build(BuildContext context) sync* {
        // this is a normal jaspr component
        yield FlutterEmbedView(
          // provide an optional loader component that will be displayed while the flutter app loads
          loader: MyCustomLoader(),
          // provide your flutter app widget
          widget: MyFlutterApp(
            // provide any widget properties or callbacks
            // this way you can pass and share state between jaspr and flutter
            // without needing js interop
            title: 'My Embedded Flutter App',
          ),
        );
      }
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Finally, run your jaspr app as normal using `jaspr serve` or `jaspr build`.
  </Step>
</Steps>

See the documentation of [FlutterEmbedView](/api/components/flutter_embed_view) for a description of all available properties.

## Deferred loading

The `jaspr_flutter_embed` package itself uses deferred imports internally to optimize the loading of the flutter framework.
To make optimal use of lazy loading the flutter framework, you should use the [FlutterEmbedView.deferred()](/api/components/flutter_embed_view#deferred-variant) constructor.

With this the flutter framework will automatically be lazy-loaded when rendering a `FlutterEmbedView` for the first time.

As a further optimization, it is also possible to **preload** the flutter framework by calling `FlutterEmbedView.preload()`.

## Import handling

Any code and components that use the flutter sdk can only be imported on the client, not the server. That means that
when you use server-side rendering, you cannot directly import the above component into your app, or you will get a
compilation error.

Instead, you need to use Darts conditional imports to only import the affected code on the client.
See [@Import](/api/utils/at_import).
