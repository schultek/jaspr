## State-Management Packages

Jasprs component system is conceptually and implementation-wise very close to Flutters 
widget system. This makes it rather easy to port popular Flutter state-management packages to Jaspr.

As an example, Jaspr has its own official port of `flutter_riverpod`:

- [`jaspr_riverpod`](https://pub.dev/packages/jaspr_riverpod).

## UI and Styling Packages

Since Jaspr works with native web technology and css, it is possible to build dart wrappers around
css frameworks that expose Jaspr components.

These are some community-maintained packages in this area:

- [jaspr_tailwind](https://pub.dev/packages/jaspr_tailwind)
- [deepyr](https://pub.dev/packages/deepyr)
- [jaspr_daisyui](https://pub.dev/packages/jaspr_daisyui)

There are also community-maintained icon packages:

- [jaspr_icons](https://pub.dev/packages/jaspr_icons)
