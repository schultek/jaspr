## Issues

## Packages

Jaspr benefits from a rich ecosystem of third-party packages. You are very welcome to create 
your own package for jaspr, e.g. as a port of an existing flutter package, a package wrapping a CSS framework, or
a component library.

Checkout [Third-Party Packages](/eco/packages) for a list of existing packages as an inspiration.

### 4. Community

You can also contribute without directly working on the core project or other packages. We want to
build an active and open community of developers around jaspr that want to push the boundaries of 
Dart on the web or server. You are welcome to be part of this community and participate in any way
you like.

For starters, join our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/XGXrGEk4c6).

If you want to further engage with the community, you can:

- Propagate Jaspr in Dart/Flutter community
- Write articles about Jaspr with examples or tutorials
- Record videos about how create web pages in Jaspr
