`Fragment` is a basic utility component that renders its `children` without any wrapper element.

```dart
return Fragment(children: [
  h1([text("Welcome")]),
  p([text("Hello World")]),
]),
```

This is meant to be used in places where you want to render multiple components, but only a single component is allowed by the API, like in the `build()` method of stateless and stateful components.
