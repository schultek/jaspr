title: "@client Components"
description: With the @client annotation you can automatically hydrate selected components on the client.

---

A component annotated with `@client` will be automatically hydrated on the client after it has been pre-rendered. In principle,
this is like 'resuming' the rendering for a component and picking up where the server-side rendering has left off.

A `@client` component acts as a 'boundary' between server and client. Components in the tree above will be rendered **only on
the server**, while components in the tree below will be rendered **both on the server and client**.

<Info>
It is generally recommended to keep a 'mental note' about which components are only rendered on the server, and which are
also rendered on the client. This distinction may become important later when you develop your website and want to import some
server-specific or client-specific library or package. Then you need to make sure that your component compiles for all environments
it will be rendered in.
</Info>

## Usage

For `@client` to work, make sure to call `Jaspr.initializeApp(options: defaultJasprOptions);`
before `runApp();` in your `main.dart` *(This is already setup when creating a new project)*.

Then simply annotate your desired component with `@client` like this:

```dart title=app.dart
import 'package:jaspr/jaspr.dart';

// Turns this into a client component.
@client
class App extends StatelessComponent {
  const App({super.key});

  @override
  Iterable<Component> build(BuildContext context) sync* {
    yield /* ... */;
  }
}
```

<Info>
Only one `@client` component per file is allowed.
</Info>

You can use `@client` components normally as any other component. You can also have multiple components annotated with
`@client` to have separate interactive parts on the client. However, nesting client components is currently not possible.

### Initializing client logic

When using `@client` components there is no default `main()` function on the client where you would normally
run any client-side initialization logic. Instead, you can make your `@client` component stateful and use the `initState()`
method for calling your initialization logic:

```dart
@override
void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Optionally skip the initialization logic on the server.
    if (kIsWeb) {
      // Your initialization logic, e.g. for setting up service locators, plugins or other global state.
    }
}
```

### Sharing state

When you use multiple `@client` components, each one will be mounted on the client in a separate component tree as the root.
Therefore if you want to share state across different `@client` components on the client, you cannot use any tree-based
state solutions like `InheritedComponent`s. Instead, you can create a global state container outside of the tree and inject
it for each `@client` component:

<Info>
The following is just an example for an implementation using `ChangeNotifier` and `InheritedComponent`.
You can also use other implementations for the container and the tree injection.
</Info>

```dart
// Some class that holds the shared state. Can be a ChangeNotifier or some other state primitive.
class StateContainer extends ChangeNotifier {
  // Your state
  State myState;
}

// Global state container to be injected into each tree.
final _container = StateContainer();

class InheritedStateContainer extends InheritedComponent {
  const InheritedStateContainer({required this.container, super.child, super.key});

  final StateContainer container;
}

@client
class MyClientComponent extends StatelessComponent {

  @override
  Iterable<Component> build(context) sync* {
    // Inject the shared container at the root of each client component tree.
    yield InheritedStateContainer(
      container: _container,
      child: /* ... */,
    );
  }
}
```

---
Many state-management solutions also have some support for this. The same concept using `jaspr_riverpod` would
look like this:

```dart
final _container = ProviderContainer();

@client
class MyClientComponent extends StatelessComponent {

  @override
  Iterable<Component> build(context) sync* {
    // Use the shared container for the provider scope.
    yield ProviderScope(
      container: _container,
      child: /* ... */,
    );
  }
}
```

### Passing data

As any other component, `@client` components can have parameters, *with certain limitations*. Parameters are automatically
serialized on the server and de-serialized on the client when hydrating the component. Therefore, using `@client` components
with parameters are a **great way to pass data from the server to the client**. For this to work, the following requirements apply:

#### 1. All parameters must be **initializing field** parameters (`this.<fieldname>`):

```dart
@client
class App extends StatelessComponent {
  const App({required this.title, super.key});

  final String title;

  /* ... */
}
```

#### 2. All parameters must be **serializable**:

Parameters must either have a primitive serializable type: `bool`, `int`, `double`, `String` or `List` / `Map`s of these.

Or you can use custom data types by using the `@encoder` and `@decoder` annotations with the class:

```dart title="model.dart"
class Model {
  @decoder
  static Model fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) => /* ... */;

  @encoder
  Map<String, dynamic> toJson() => /* ... */;
}
```

Learn more about how to set up serialization for custom data types using the [`@encoder`/ `@decoder`](/api/utils/at_encoder_decoder) annotations.

With this setup you can use any class as the parameter of a `@client` component.

## How it works

The following happens when you use a `@client` component:

*during build:*

1. The component (along with some framework bits) is compiled to a separate js entrypoint.

*on the server:*

2. The component is built and pre-rendered normally.
3. Jaspr adds a html marker (`<!--$<name> data=<serialized-parameters>-->`) around your components output.
4. Jaspr adds the components js target as a `<script>` tag to the documents `<head>`.

*on the client:*

5. The browser loads the pre-rendered html and compiled js scripts.
6. The used component is located based on the html marker.
7. The parameters are deserialized and the component is mounted to the target element.
