title: runApp()
description: Runs your Jaspr site on either the server or the client.

---

To run your site, use the `runApp` function and provide your root component.

```dart
runApp(MyComponent());
```

This function works both on the client and on the server when you use **static** or **server** mode.

1. **On the server** this starts a http server that renders the given component to html for every
incoming request.

2. **On the client** this attaches the given component to the DOM and thereby making your app interactive.
