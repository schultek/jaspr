title: Project Configuration
description: The configuration options for a Jaspr project.
---

---

Each Jaspr project is a normal Dart project including a `pubspec.yaml` file and `lib/` directory.

The project-wide Jaspr configuration is specified in `pubspec.yaml` under the `jaspr` option:

```yaml
name: my_project
...

jaspr:
  mode: server
  port: 8080
  flutter: plugins
```

There are currently the following configuration options available:

<Property name="mode" type="Enum" required>

  Sets the [**Rendering Mode**](/dev/modes) for your project. Either `static`, `server` or `client`.
</Property>

---

<Property name="port" type="int" optional>

  *Only applicable in "static" or "server" mode.*

  Specifies the target port to use when **serving** your project. This is optional and defaults to "8080" if not set. Can be overridden by the `--port` flag with `jaspr serve`.
</Property>

---

<Property name="flutter" type="Enum" optional>

  Specifies the Flutter support for your project.

  - `embedded`: Enables [Flutter embedding](/going_further/flutter_embedding) support, allowing you to use Flutter widgets inside Jaspr components.
  - `plugins`: Enables Flutter plugin support, allowing you to use Flutter plugins that provide web support inside your project.
  - `none` or omitted: No Flutter support.

  Using either `embedded` or `plugins` requires the Flutter SDK to be installed and available in your system PATH, as well as a dependency on `build_web_compilers` with a minimum version constraint of `4.4.6` or higher.
</Property>
