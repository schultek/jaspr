# 🖍 Writing html

With jaspr, you write html as part of your component tree. Each html tag (like `div`, `p`, `img`, etc.) has an assigned
method you can use (reps. `div()`, `p()`, `img()`, etc.).

Let's look at the following html snippet:

```html
<div>
  <h1>This is a title</h1>
  <p>Hello <b>World!</b></p>
</div>
```

Within a jaspr component, this can be represented as such:

```dart
div([
  h1([text('This is a title')]),
  p([text('Hello '), b([text('World!')])]),
]);
```

The special `text()` method does not add a html tag but renders plain text inside other elements.

---

There exist methods for the most common html tags, like `div`, `a`, `p`, `img` as well as more special tags like
`video`, `form`, `input` and others.

<Info>
If you want support for a tag that does not have such a method yet, please don't hesitate to open an issue on github.
</Info>

Each method has the following signature:

```dart
Component <tagname>(List<Component> children, {Key? key, String? id, List<String>? classes, Styles? styles, Map<String, String>? attributes, Map<String, EventCallback>? events});
```

In addition to these parameters some methods have tag-specific attributes, like `img(src: "...")` or `a(href: "...")`.

For readability, it is recommended to put the list of child components last in the parameter list:
`div(id: "main", [text('Hello World')])` is more readable than `div([text('Hello World')], id: "main")`.
In case of no children specify an empty list (`[]`). Some tags also omit this parameter, like `img`.

Finally, here are some more examples of this syntax. You can switch between the dart code and rendered html output.

<CodeGroup title="Header tag">
  ```dart
    h1([text('Hello jaspr')])
  ```
  ```html
    <h1>Hello jaspr</h1>
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<CodeGroup title="Paragraph with multiple children">
  ```dart
    p([
      text('This is some '),
      b([text('html')]),
      text(' content.'),
    ])
  ```
  ```html
    <p>This is some <b>html</b> content.</p>
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<CodeGroup title="Anchor with an image">
  ```dart
    a(href: "https://github.com/schultek/jaspr", target: Target.blank, [
      img(src: "https://jasprpad.schultek.de/jaspr-192.png"),
    ])
  ```
  ```html
    <a href="https://github.com/schultek/jaspr" target="_blank">
      <img src="https://jasprpad.schultek.de/jaspr-192.png" />
    </a>
  ```
</CodeGroup>

- Select input:
  ```dart
  select(events: {
    'change': (e) => print(e.target.value),
  }, [
    option(value: 'test', [text('Select me!')]),
    option(value: 'other', selected: true, [text('Or me!')])
  ])
  ```

- Progress bar:
  ```dart
  progress(value: 85, max: 100, [])
  ```


## DomComponent

Under the hood, every html element in jaspr is represented by a `DomComponent`, which is a special component that takes
a **tag**, some other parameters and a list of children, which can again be other `DomComponents`.

If you want to, you can write `DomComponent`s manually instead of using the utility methods. This gives you great low-level
control over your html structure, but is more verbose.

```dart
  var component = DomComponent(
    tag: 'div',
    id: 'my-id',
    classes: ['class-a', 'class-b'],
    attributes: {'my-attribute': 'my-value'},
    events: {'click': (e) => print('clicked')},
    children: [
      ...
    ],
  );
```

Using this component would render the following html:

```html
<div id="my-id" class="class-a class-b" my-attribute="my-value">
  ...
</div>
```

<Info>
    `DomComponent` is the lowest-level component for rendering html tags and gives you the most flexibility. However it is
    also very verbose. Therefore jaspr comes with a set of utility functions for creating most common html tags, like `div`,
    `button` etc. See [Writing Html](/core/html) for more details.
</Info>

## Text

A simple component that renders a text node.

A text node in html is just some standalone string that is placed inside another html element. Therefore the `Text`
component also only receives a single string to render to the page.

```dart
  var text = Text('Hello World!');
```

As usual for web, styling is done through a combination of CSS attributes, either in a **Stylesheet** or inline though
the **`style` attribute** of the parent elements.

For example rendering a simple heading would look like this:

```dart
  var heading = DomComponent(
    tag: 'h1',
    styles: Styles.text(color: Colors.blue),
    child: Text('Hello World!'),
  );
```

rendering:

```html
<h1 style="color: blue;">Hello World!</h1>
```
