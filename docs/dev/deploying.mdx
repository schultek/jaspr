description: Learn how to deploy your Jaspr site to any hosting provider.
---

---

A website built with Jaspr can be deployed to nearly any standard web hosting provider. The form of deployment
depends on your chosen [Rendering Mode](/dev/modes):

- **static**: Deploy your pre-rendered site to any static hosting provider.
- **server**: Deploy your server application to any Dart hosting provider or containerized hosting service using Docker.
- **client**: Deploy your site to any static hosting provider.

---

## Static Hosting

With **static** or **client** mode you will have a purely static site after running `jaspr build`. This means that you
can just take the `/build/jaspr` folder and deploy it to any static hosting provider.

### Firebase Hosting

To deploy your site to [Firebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting) follow these steps:

1. Run `jaspr build`

2. Run `firebase init` inside your project directory.

   1. Select the "Hosting" feature
   2. Set the public directory to `build/jaspr`
   3. For **static** mode select "No" when asked to configure as a single-page app, for **client** mode select "Yes"
   4. Select "No" when asked to override `index.html`.

3. Run `firebase deploy`

<Info>
  There is no additional step to add Flutter support. After it's been deployed a
  Page Not Found page from Firebase may be shown initially but afterwards your
  website will be shown.
</Info>

### Github Pages

With [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) you can automatically deploy your when you push to a configured repository
and branch. Since you need to run `jaspr build` before deploying, it's recommended to set up a custom
[Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) workflow to build and deploy your site automatically when pushed.

First we set up the repository to deploy from your repository:

<Info>
  This will roughly follow the steps from [this
  guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#ver%C3%B6ffentlichen-mit-einem-benutzerdefinierten-github-actions-workflow)
  of the official documentation.
</Info>

1. Go to your repository and open "Settings" -> "Pages"
2. Set the "Source" to "GitHub Actions"
3. Find the suggested "Static HTML" workflow and click "Configure"
4. Edit the default workflow script to the following:
   1. After the "Setup Pages" step add the following two step:
      ```yaml
      - name: 'Setup Dart'
        uses: dart-lang/setup-dart@v1.3
      - name: 'Build Jaspr'
        run: |
          dart pub global activate jaspr_cli
          jaspr build --verbose
      ```
   2. In the "Upload artifact" step change the "path" variable to `build/jaspr`
      ```yaml
      with:
        # Upload only jaspr build output
        path: 'build/jaspr'
      ```
5. Click "Commit changes" and commit the new workflow file.

#### Modifying the code

If you are deploying from the special `<username>.github.io` repository you are all set and you can view your deployed
site at `https://<username>.github.io.`.

If you are deploying from any other repository, the site url will be `http://<username>.github.io/<repository>`. For this
to correctly load all files you need to set the `<base>` url of your site to the repository name.

In static mode, provide the `base` parameter to the `Document` constructor:

```dart
Document(
  base: '<repository>',
  body: /* ... */
),
```

In client mode, add the `<base>` element to `index.html` inside `<head>`:

```html
<head>
  <base href="/<repository>/" />
</head>
```

Finally, make sure all links and asset paths are **relative urls** (they don't start with '/').

#### Flutter support

If your project is using Flutter embedding or Flutter plugins, you need to modify the created workflow file to also 
pull in flutter, otherwise the build will result in an error.

- After the "Setup Dart" step add the following step:
  ```yaml
  - name: 'Setup Flutter'
    uses: subosito/flutter-action@v2
  ```
- Commit and push the file.

---

## Server Hosting

With **server** mode `jaspr build` will generate a server executable `app.exe` and an additional assets folder `web/`
to `/build/jaspr`. When deploying this executable, make sure to deploy the asset folder with it.

### Docker

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is a very common tool for containerizing any application to run it virtually anywhere.
Lots of cloud hosting services support deploying docker containers, like:

- [Google Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run)
- [AWS Amplify](https://docs.amplify.aws/gen1/flutter/tools/cli/usage/containers)
- [fly.io](https://fly.io/docs/languages-and-frameworks/dockerfile/)
- [Digital Ocean](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform/how-to/deploy-from-container-images/)
- any many more...

The main thing to set up when using docker is the `Dockerfile`, a build script that creates the container image.

Create a new file called `Dockerfile` (no extension) at the root directory of your project with the following content:

```dockerfile
# Use the official dart docker image as our build image.
FROM dart:stable as build

# Activate the jaspr cli.
RUN dart pub global activate jaspr_cli

WORKDIR /app
# Copy all files into the current image.
COPY . .

# Resolve app dependencies.
RUN rm -f pubspec_overrides.yaml
RUN dart pub get

# Build project
RUN dart pub global run jaspr_cli:jaspr build --verbose

# Use a new empty docker image, this will be the final container image.
FROM scratch

# Copy all the needed runtime libraries for dart.
COPY --from=build /runtime/ /
# Copy the build outputs for your site.
COPY --from=build /app/build/jaspr/ /app/

WORKDIR /app

# Start the server.
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["./app"]
```

Running `docker build` from your project directory will then build a container image that you can deploy.

#### Flutter support

If your project is using Flutter embedding or Flutter plugins you need to modify the `Dockerfile` to also have 
Flutter installed in the build image, otherwise the build will result in an error.

First change the first lines to the following:

```dockerfile
# We need a docker image that has flutter installed.
FROM ghcr.io/cirruslabs/flutter:stable as build
```

Next replace the script starting from "FROM scratch" with the following:

```dockerfile
# This image is additionally needed for the dart runtime libs.
FROM dart:stable as dart

# Use a new empty docker image, this will be the final container image.
FROM scratch

# Copy all the needed runtime libraries for dart.
COPY --from=dart /runtime/ /
# Copy the build outputs for your site.
COPY --from=build /app/build/jaspr/ /app/

WORKDIR /app

# Start the server.
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["./app"]
```

## Globe

[Globe](https://globe.dev/) is a hosting platform for Dart & Flutter applications from Invertase. It offers a streamlined deployment experience, automatically detecting your Jaspr project's configuration and rendering mode.

1. Install the Globe CLI:

   ```bash
   dart pub global activate globe_cli
   ```

2. Run the deployment command from your project's root directory:

   ```bash
   globe deploy --prod
   ```

3. For your first deployment, the CLI will guide you through creating and linking a new Globe project.

Globe will then build and deploy your application, providing you with a unique URL (e.g., `https://your-project-name.globeapp.dev`).

### Flutter Support

No additional configuration is needed. Globe's build pipeline automatically detects and sets up projects that use 
Flutter for element embedding or plugins.
