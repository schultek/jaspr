To generate a static site with Jaspr, you need to use the `static` rendering mode. This mode allows you to pre-render your website at build time, generating static HTML and CSS files that can be hosted on any static hosting provider.

## Generating Pages

Static-Site Generation (SSG) describes the process of generating all your website routes at build time. Different to SSR, this doesn't require a running server that generates your website on each request. Instead, `jaspr build` will generate all the routes for your website and outputs only static files (`.html`, etc.) that can be deployed to any static hosting provider.

Say you have a project in `static` mode with the routes `/`, `/about` and `/contact`. Then running `jaspr build` will output the `index.html`, `about/index.html` and `contact/index.html` files.

To make sure all pages are generated for your site, you need to tell Jaspr about the routes of your website.

### Using `jaspr_router`

It is recommended you use `jaspr_router` together with `static` mode, since it automatically renders all routes that you define.

The following shows a router that would render the above three routes:

```dart
Router(
  routes: [
    Route(path: '/', builder: (_, _) => HomePage()),
    Route(path: '/about', builder: (_, _) => AboutPage()),
    Route(path: '/contact', builder: (_, _) => ContactPage()),
  ]
);
```

#### Generating dynamic routes

You may want to generate dynamic routes based on some data for your application.

Take for example a typical blog site, where each blog post has its own route, e.g. `/posts/{postId}`, and you want
to render these as separate pages when running `jaspr build`. Normally, you could use routes with path parameters for this,
however for static-site generation, path parameters are not supported, since all routes need to be resolvable when initializing the router.

Instead, you need to add a route for each page you want generated:

```dart
Router(
  routes: [
    for (var post in posts)
      Route(path: '/posts/${post.id}', /* ... */),
  ],
);
```

Here, the `posts` list may be loaded from a database before the component builds.

### Manual usage

If you want to set this up manually, you need to call `ServerApp.requestRouteGeneration('/my_route');` for any of your
routes you want to generate.

Since `ServerApp` is only available through the `package:jaspr/server.dart` import, you need to make sure this is only part of your
server code and not the client.

The method should be called during the initial build of your app, so putting it into `initState()` of your root component is a good choice.

## Content-Driven Sites

If you are building a content-heavy site like a blog, documentation or marketing page, it is recommended to use the `jaspr_content` package.

This package provides a set of tools to load, parse, and render content from markdown files, along with support for frontmatter, templating, and custom components.
It works great with static-site generation and automatically generates routes for your content.

## Generating a Sitemap

Jaspr can automatically generate a sitemap for your static site. To enable this, pass the `--sitemap-domain` argument to the `jaspr build` command, e.g.

```bash
jaspr build --sitemap-domain https://example.com
```

This will generate a `sitemap.xml` file in the output directory, which contains all the routes that were generated during the build process.

You can customize the sitemap entries by passing a `RouteSettings` object to your routes:

```dart
Router(
  routes: [
    Route(path: '/summary', settings: RouteSettings(changeFreq: ChangeFreq.weekly, priority: 0.9)),
  ],
);
````

This will set the `changefreq` and `priority` attributes for the sitemap entry of this route like this:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<urlset xmlns="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9">
  ...
  <url>
    <loc>https://example.com/summary</loc>
    <changefreq>weekly</changefreq>
    <priority>0.9</priority>
  </url>
  ...
</urlset>
```
