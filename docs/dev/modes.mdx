title: Rendering Modes
description: Jaspr comes with three different rendering modes - static, server and client.
---

---

**Jaspr** is a full-stack web framework, meaning it can run both on the server and the client. Depending on what you
want to build, you can choose how your website should be built and executed using Jaspr.

Jaspr supports the following three rendering modes:

<Card title="Static Mode" icon="1">
  In static mode Jaspr performs **static rendering** (also known as Static Site Generation) at build time, generating a fully static site that you can deploy anywhere.
</Card>
<Card title="Server Mode" icon="2">
  In server mode Jaspr builds a **server application** that pre-renders your components for each incoming request (also known as Server Side Rendering).
</Card>
<Card title="Client Mode" icon="3">
  If you want, you can skip the server and pre-rendering part of Jaspr completely and use it as a client-side only framework.
</Card>

Each mode is explained in more detail below. The following table gives a quick comparison:

|                               | **static**         | **server**           | **client** |
| :---------------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------- | ---------- |
| **Client-Side Interactivity** | ✅                 | ✅                   | ✅         |
| **Pre-Rendering**             | ✅ (at build time) | ✅ (at request time) | ❌         |
| **Pure Dart**                 | ✅                 | ✅                   | ❌         |
| **Static Deployment**         | ✅                 | ❌                   | ✅         |
| **Backend Integration**       | ❌                 | ✅                   | ❌         |

You can configure the rendering mode for your project in `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
jaspr:
  mode: static # or 'server' or 'client'
```

## Static Mode

With this mode, Jaspr will generate a fully static site when building your project that you can host at any common website hosting service.
You can write server-side code to pre-render components and pages at built time, outputting clean HTML and CSS to deploy anywhere.
Additionally, you can set up hydration on the client in order to make your site interactive.

<Info>
  Even if you want to build a Single Page Application this can be a good choice
  over 'client' mode since you don't need a `index.html` or `styles.css` and
  instead can write everything in Dart and let Jaspr do the rendering to actual
  HTML/CSS files during build.
</Info>

To lean more about generating static sites with Jaspr, check out the [Static Sites](/dev/static_sites) guide.

If you want to build a **content-driven** site (like a blog or documentation site) check out [Jaspr Content](/content).

## Server Mode

In this mode Jaspr runs and builds a server application that pre-renders your components for each incoming request.
You can use either Jaspr's inbuilt webserver or choose to integrate it into your favorite Dart backend framework.
Additionally, you can set up hydration on the client in order to make your site interactive.

To deploy your site, you either need a service that supports Dart deployments or otherwise bundle your application with e.g. Docker. See the [Deploying](/dev/deploying) guide for more information.

During server-side rendering, you can access the request url, [headers](/api/utils/headers) and [cookies](/api/utils/cookies) through context extensions (e.g. `context.url`). You can also modify the response [headers](/api/utils/headers#contextsetheader), [cookies](/api/utils/cookies#contextsetcookie) and [status code](/api/utils/set_status_code).

## Client Mode

If you want, you can skip the server and pre-rendering part of Jaspr completely and use it as a client-side only framework.
Similar to static mode, you can deploy your built site to any common website hosting service without needing an extra server.
