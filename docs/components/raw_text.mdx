# RawText
*Renders raw HTML from a String.*

---

The `RawText` component renders its input text as raw and unescaped HTML.

```dart
yield RawText('<div>Hello HTML</div>');
```

renders to:

```html
<div>Hello HTML</div>
```

<Warning>

vulnerable to [cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/).
Make sure to sanitize any user input when using this component.
</Warning>

The component can be used both on the server and the client and supports deep updates of the provided html.
