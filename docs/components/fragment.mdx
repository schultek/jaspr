`Fragment` is a basic utility component that renders its `children` without any wrapper element.

```dart
Fragment(children: [
  h1([text("Welcome")]),
  p([text("Hello World")]),
]),
```

This is meant to be used in places where you want to render multiple components,
but only a single component is allowed by the API.
For example a custom builder method that only allows returning a single `Component`, like [Route.builder](/components/router#defining-routes).
