The following is the recommended project structure for any Jaspr website. The concrete files vary slightly depending on your chosen [**Rendering Mode**](/dev/modes).

```

│   ├── components/              // Shared components
│   │   ├── counter.dart
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── pages/                   // The pages of your website
│   │   ├── home.dart
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── app.dart                 // The main app component, usually containing the Router
│   ├── ...
│   ├── main.client.dart         // The client entrypoint, for all modes, optional
│   ├── main.client.options.dart // Auto-generated by Jaspr
│   ├── main.server.dart         // The server entrypoint, only for server or static mode
│   └── main.server.optionsdart  // Auto-generated by Jaspr

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion defaultOpen title="lib/">

    The `lib` directory contains all your usual dart code, including components, pages, routes etc.
    depending on your architecture.

    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion defaultOpen title="lib/main.server.dart">

        The `lib/main.server.dart` file is the entry point for your **server** application. It calls `runApp()`
        and provides your root document component. Only needed for static or server mode.

        <Info>
          You can also have other `*.server.dart` files and choose one with `--input` flag when running your project.
        </Info>

      </Accordion>
      <Accordion defaultOpen title="lib/main.client.dart">

        The `lib/main.client.dart` file is the entrypoint for your **client** environment. It calls `runApp()` and
        either provides your root component (in client mode), or the `ClientApp()` component (in static or server mode) which
        hydrates all `@client` components.

        <Info>
          You can also have other `*.client.dart` files. Any `*.client.dart` file inside `lib/` is automatically compiled to JavaScript. In static and server mode, any file that has a peer `<filename>.server.dart` file is automatically loaded as a script tag. In client mode, or for using non-peer `*.client.dart` files you need to manually include a script tag pointing to `<filename>.client.dart.js` in your page.
        </Info>
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="lib/*.options.dart">

        The `*.options.dart` files are auto-generated by Jaspr's tooling. It exposes a top-level `defaultServerOptions` or `defaultClientOptions` that you should provide to the `Jaspr.initializeApp(options: ...)` call inside `*.<server|client>.dart`.

      </Accordion>
    </AccordionGroup>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion defaultOpen title="web/">

    The `web` directory contains any static assets you want to access from your website, like images or fonts.
    Files inside this directory are later accessible through their relative url, e.g. `<domain>/images/logo.png`.

    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion defaultOpen title="web/index.html">

        The `web/index.html` file (along with other html and css files) is only needed in client mode and contains the static markup and styling for your website.
