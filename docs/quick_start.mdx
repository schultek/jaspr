Welcome to the Jaspr Getting Started guide. In it, you'll install Jaspr, setup a new project and learn the basics of Jaspr.

## 1. Install Jaspr
  
You can install Jaspr either through our **VSCode Extension** or by installing the **Jaspr CLI** in the terminal. The CLI lets you manage the project from the command line, while the extension provides a more integrated experience within your IDE.

- <Icon name="cubes" /> Use the Jaspr VSCode Extension to setup and serve your website with full debugging support from inside VSCode.
- <Icon name="terminal" /> Use the Jaspr CLI to setup and serve your website from the command line.

<Tabs groupId="tooling">
  <TabItem label="VSCode Extension" value="extension">
    Install the Jaspr VSCode extension by searching for `Jaspr` in the extensions menu.

    After installing and activating the extension, you will get a prompt to install the Jaspr CLI. Accept it to continue.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Jaspr CLI" value="cli">
    Install the Jaspr CLI via:

    ```js
    dart pub global activate jaspr_cli
    ```

    The `jaspr` command will be available in your terminal.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
    
## 2. Choose a Rendering Mode

The first thing to do when starting a new project with Jaspr is to decide on a **Rendering Mode** to use. 
The rendering mode defines how your website is executed and built and each one has it's own advantages and disadvantages based on what you want to build.

Jaspr supports these three rendering modes:

<Card title="Static Mode" icon="1">
  In static mode Jaspr performs **static rendering** (also known as Static Site Generation) at build time, generating a fully static site that you can deploy anywhere.

  **Recommended for most websites, landing pages, portfolios, blogs, documentation sites, etc.**
</Card>
<Card title="Server Mode" icon="2">
  In server mode Jaspr builds a **server application** that pre-renders your components for each incoming request (also known as Server Side Rendering).

  **Recommended for web applications that require backend integration, user authentication, or dynamic content that changes frequently.**
</Card>
<Card title="Client Mode" icon="3">
  If you want, you can skip the server and pre-rendering part of Jaspr completely and use it as a client-side only framework.
</Card>

All modes support client-side interactivity and can be used to build interactive web applications. The main difference is when and how the initial HTML is generated. Read more about rendering modes [here](dev/modes).

## 3. Create your Project

<Tabs groupId="tooling">
  <TabItem label="VSCode Extension" value="extension">
    To create a new Jaspr project, open the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and select **Jaspr: New Project**. You are ask to choose from several templates and set a project folder.

    ![New Project](https://github.com/schultek/jaspr/blob/main/modules/jaspr-code/media/screenshots/new_project.png?raw=true)

    The first three templates are the default choices for each rendering mode: static, server and client. The fourth option includes an embedded Flutter web app and the fifth comes with a custom backend setup using `shelf`.

    <Info>
      Choosing a template will not lock you into a specific configuration. Starting from one template you can easily modify your code to behave as any other template along the way.
    </Info>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Jaspr CLI" value="cli">
    To create a new project run:

    ```
    jaspr create my_website
    ```

    This will walk you through the setup wizard and create a new Jaspr project inside the `my_website` folder.

    The cli will prompt you with a set of options to configure your project. You can read about what each option does [here](dev/cli#creating-a-new-project) or just start with the recommended ones (simply press **Enter** each time).

    Alternatively, you can select a pre-made template using the `--template` option.

    <Info>
        Choosing a set of options do not lock you into a specific configuration. Starting from one setup you can easily modify your code to behave as any other setup along the way.
    </Info>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## 4. Run your Project
    
<Tabs groupId="tooling">
  <TabItem label="VSCode Extension" value="extension">
    To run and debug a Jaspr applications, launch it using F5 or the Debug menu. The extension will start the debug process and attach the Dart debugger to it. 

    ---

    When developing a Jaspr project in `static` or `server` mode, this will open **two** separate debugging sessions, one for the server and one for the client. Switch between the two using the debugging sidebar or process dropdown.

    | Sidebar | Dropdown. |
    |---|---|
    | ![Sidebar](https://github.com/schultek/jaspr/blob/main/modules/jaspr-code/media/screenshots/sidebar.png?raw=true) | ![Dropdown](https://github.com/schultek/jaspr/blob/main/modules/jaspr-code/media/screenshots/dropdown.png?raw=true)

    Both processes will be managed by the main Jaspr terminal.

    ![Terminal](https://github.com/schultek/jaspr/blob/main/modules/jaspr-code/media/screenshots/terminal.png?raw=true)

    To stop the server, click "Stop Jaspr" in the status bar, or focus the terminal and press `Ctrl+C`. This will stop both debugging sessions and the main process.
    You can also detach the debugging sessions individually using the detach button in the debug bar, but this will keep the app running.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Jaspr CLI" value="cli">
    Start the development server via:

    ```shell
    cd my_website
    jaspr serve
    ```

    This will spin up a development server at `localhost:8080`.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
