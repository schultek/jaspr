title: Writing HTML
description: How to write concise html markup in Jaspr.
---

---

With jaspr, you write HTML as part of your component tree. Each HTML tag (like `div`, `p`, `img`, etc.) has an assigned component you can use (resp. `div()`, `p()`, `img()`, etc.).

Let's look at the following HTML snippet:

```html
<div>
  <h1>This is a title</h1>
  <p>Hello <b>World!</b></p>
</div>
```

Within a Jaspr component, this can be represented as such:

```dart
div([
  h1([.text('This is a title')]),
  p([.text('Hello '), b([.text('World!')])]),
]);
```

The `.text()` is the dot-shorthands version of `Component.text()`, which does not add a HTML tag but renders plain text inside other elements.

## HTML utilities
  
There exist components for the most common HTML tags, like `div`, `a`, `p`, `img` as well as more special tags like
`video`, `form`, `input` and others.

<Info>
If you want support for a tag that does not have such a method yet, please don't hesitate to open an issue on github.
</Info>

These components are available under the `package:jaspr/dom.dart` library, and each component is defined like this:

```dart
class <tagname> extends Component {
  const <tagname>(
    List<Component> children, {
    String? id,
    String? classes,
    Styles? styles,
    Map<String, String>? attributes,
    Map<String, EventCallback>? events,
    Key? key,
  });
}
```

In addition to these common properties some components support tag-specific properties, like `img(src: "...")` or `a(href: "...")`.

<Info>

For readability, it is recommended to put the list of child components last in the parameter list:
`div(id: "main", [.text('Hello World')])` is more readable than `div([.text('Hello World')], id: "main")`.
In case of no children specify an empty list (`[]`). Some tags also omit this parameter, like `img`.

Finally, here are some more examples of this syntax. You can switch between the dart code and rendered html output.

<CodeGroup title="Paragraph with rich text">
  ```dart
    p([.text('This is some '),b([.text('html')]),.text(' content.')])
  ```
  ```html
    <p>This is some <b>html</b> content.</p>
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<CodeGroup title="Heading with blue text">
    ```dart
    h1(styles: Styles(color: Colors.blue), [.text('Hello Jaspr!')])
    ```
    ```html
    <h1 style="color: blue;">Hello Jaspr!</h1>
    ```
</CodeGroup>

<CodeGroup title="Anchor with an image">
  ```dart
    a(href: "https://github.com/schultek/jaspr", target: .blank, [
      img(src: "https://playground.jaspr.site/jaspr-192.png"),
    ])
  ```
  ```html
    <a href="https://github.com/schultek/jaspr" target="_blank">
      <img src="https://playground.jaspr.site/jaspr-192.png" />
    </a>
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<CodeGroup title="Select input">
  ```dart
    select([
      option(value: 'test', [.text('Select me!')]),
      option(value: 'other', selected: true, [.text('Or me!')])
    ])
  ```
  ```html
    <select>
      <option value="test">Select me!</option>
      <option value="other" selected>Or me!</option>
    </select>
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<CodeGroup title="Progress bar">
    ```dart
    progress(value: 85, max: 100, [])
    ```
    ```html
    <progress value="85" max="100"></progress>
    ```
</CodeGroup>
