Jaspr is highly flexible when it comes to styling. Write your own styles, or reference local and external stylesheets.
You can use Jasprs own type-safe CSS-in-Dart styling system or integrate CSS frameworks to style your website.

## CSS-in-Dart

Jaspr gives you a strongly-typed styles system that wraps the most common css properties. You can
access these various properties through the [`Styles`](/utils/styles) class that is exported by the core package.

When defining styles like this, you can use them to write component-level styles, global styles, or set inline styles for html elements.

### Component Styles

The recommended approach is to define your styles inside your components for better locality of your code:

```dart lib/app.dart
class App extends StatelessComponent {
  const App({super.key});

  @override
  Iterable<Component> build(BuildContext context) sync* {
    yield div(classes: 'main', [
      p([text('Hello World')]),
    ]);
  }

  @css
  static final styles = [
    css('.main', [
      css('&').styles(
        width: 100.px,
        padding: Padding.all(10.rem),
      ),
      css('p').styles(
        color: Colors.blue,
      ),
    ]),
  ];
}
```

Read more about this approach in the documentation for [@Ã§ss](/utils/at_css).

**Tip:** The `jaspr_lints` package provides a convenient lint rule to keep your styles properties organized. Learn more about it [here](/get_started/linting#lint-rules).
</Success>

### Global Stylesheet

You can define a global stylesheet from your Dart code using one of the following options:

1. Passing [Style Rules](/utils/at_css#defining-style-rules) to [Document(styles: ...)](/components/document#parameters). This will render the provided styles into a global stylesheet inside the `<head>` element.

2. Using the [@css](/utils/at_css#registering-style-rules) annotation on a global variable to automatically render the annotated styles into a global stylesheet inside the `<head>` element.

3. Using the [Style](/components/style) component to manually define a `<style>` element anywhere in the tree.

### Inline Styles

You can also pass a `Styles` instance to any html component, which will then render as inline css styles:

```dart
div(styles: const Styles(backgroundColor: Colors.red), []);
```

renders to:

```html
<div style="background-color: red"></div>
```

<Info>
Try to prefer `const` styles whenever possible, which will benefit the performance and size of your site.

### Responsive styles

To make your styles responsive and e.g. change based on the screen width or height, use the `css.media()` utility. This will render [css `@media` queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_media_queries/Using_media_queries).

> Media queries allow you to apply CSS styles depending on a device's media type (such as print vs. screen) or other features or characteristics such as screen resolution or orientation, aspect ratio, browser viewport width or height, user preferences such as preferring reduced motion, data usage, or transparency.

Provide a `MediaQuery` as well as child styles to the function:

```dart
@css
final styles = [
    css('.main').styles(
      display: Display.flex, 
      flexDirection: FlexDirection.row,
    ),
    css.media(MediaQuery.screen(maxWidth: 600.px), [
      css('.main').styles(
        flexDirection: FlexDirection.column,
      ),
    ]),
];
```

The above rules define a row layout for larger screens and a column layout for smaller (`< 600px`) screens.

## External Stylesheets

If you are writing `.css` stylesheets manually or have external stylesheets you want to use, you can add
them as a `<link rel="stylesheet">` inside the `<head>` element.

When you are in **static** or **server** mode, add this to [Document(head: ...)](/components/document#parameters):

```dart title="lib/main.dart"
void main() {
  runApp(Document(
    /* ... */ // other properties
    head: [
      link(rel: "stylesheet", href: "/path/to/your/stylesheet.css"),
    ],
    body: App(),
  ));
}
```

When you are in **client** mode, add this directly to the `index.html` file:

```html title="web/index.html"
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="/path/to/your/stylesheet.css"/>
</head>
```

### Dynamically Adding Stylesheets

You can use the [Document.head()](/components/document#documenthead) component to dynamically set a value in the `<head>`
from any component.

```dart
class MyCustomComponent extends StatelessComponent {

  Iterable<Component> build(BuildContext context) sync* {
    yield Document.head(children: [
      link(rel: "stylesheet", href: "/some/extra/stylesheet.css"),
    ]);
  }
}
```

## Using Third-Party CSS Frameworks

There are lots of other options from the CSS landscape that you can integrate with Jaspr.

<Info>
Remember, Jaspr sites are just normal websites. You can do (almost) all the same things.
</Info>

Some common css solutions include:

- CSS Utility Frameworks, like [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- CSS Component Frameworks, like [Bulma](https://bulma.io/)
- CSS Preprocessors, like [Dart Sass](https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass/)

### Tailwind

Jaspr has a first-party Tailwind integration. Check it out [here](/eco/tailwind).

### Bulma

> Bulma is a free, open source framework that provides ready-to-use frontend components that you can easily combine to build responsive web interfaces.

With Bulma (and other similar css component frameworks) you basically only need to add specific classes to your
html elements to style them as read-made components.

See the [Bulma Example](https://playground.jaspr.site/?sample=bulma) on JasprPad for some basic example components.

### Dart Sass

The easiest way to integrate the Sass preprocessor into your dart project is by using the
[sass_builder](https://pub.dev/packages/sass_builder) package.

After setting up the package, simply create a `.scss` file:

```scss title="web/styles.scss"
@use "package:bootstrap_sass/scss/variables" as bootstrap;

.a {
  color: blue;
}
.c {
  color: bootstrap.$body-color;
}
```

and include the generated output `.css` file as an [external stylesheet](/concepts/styling#external-stylesheets):

```dart
link(rel:"stylesheet", href: "/styles.css")
```
