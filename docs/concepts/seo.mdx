Jaspr gives you all the tools you need to build websites with great SEO performance. Below is a collection
of features and techniques related to improving SEO for your site.

<Info>
This page is about what features Jaspr has that relate to SEO, not an in-depth guide on how to generally do SEO for websites. There are lots of other resources on that topic, most of which are applicable for any kind of website and translate well to Jaspr.

## Pre-rendering

Pre-rendering can improve SEO performance in a meaningful way, since the browser immediately receives the full html of your website and doesn't need to wait until the javascript is loaded to display your content.

This is a core feature of Jaspr and supported by both **static** and **server** mode. See [Rendering Modes](/get_started/modes) for more details on this topic.

## Meta Information

The meta information of your website is usually supposed to be consumed by search engines, crawlers or social previews. It consists of non-ui elements like title and meta tags like description, keywords or social preview image.

Common meta tags include:

- **description**: A short description of your site. This is typically what is shown in search results of your site.
- **keywords**: Some keywords for your site.
- **og:title**: The title to show in a social preview card.
- **og:image**: The image to show in a social preview card.

### Static meta information

Out-of-the-box, Jaspr sets sensible defaults for this information, which you can override if needed.

In **static** or **server** mode, the [Document](/components/document) component has a couple of parameters that can be
used to set the following information:

- **title**: Sets the overall `<title>` of the site.
- **lang**: Sets the `<html lang="...">` attribute that defines the language of the site.
- **viewport**: Sets the viewport of the site, defaults to `'width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0'`.
- **meta**: Sets any additional `<meta>` tags.

In **client** mode the `web/index.html` file contains some default tags inside `<head>`, which can be customized as needed.

### Dynamic meta information

In the above section you learn how to set meta information for the whole website. However in many cases, you want to set
page specific information, e.g. the `/users` page should have a different description than the home page, or a `/article/:articleId`
should have a summary of the article as its description together with a social preview image.

In these cases you can use the `Document.head()` component to set meta information
from **anywhere in the component tree**. This will override the global meta information e.g. for a specific route.

```dart
Document.head(
  title: "My Page Title",
  meta: {"description": "My Page Description"}
),
```

See the [Document.head()](/components/document#documenthead) docs for more details on how to use it.

## Reducing the amount of loaded javascript

The best way to improve the load time of your website on the client is to simply reduce the amount of javascript
that needs to be loaded by the browser.

An important consideration for this is to think about what part of your website actually needs to be interactive, and then only shipping javascript for that part.

For example if you are building a blog site with mostly static content but with one small "Like" button on the page, its rather inefficient to ship the whole component tree to the client just to make that button interactive. Rather you should use targeted [hydration](/get_started/hydration) to only ship the button component.

If you are using [@client](/utils/at_client) component, this translates to "move the `@client` annotation as much down the component tree as possible". See the [Hydration](/get_started/hydration) docs for more details.

Once you have optimized the overall hydration of your site, you can use code splitting to further reduce the initial js bundle size.

### Code Splitting

Code splitting can improve the load time of your client-side javascript bundle that is compiled from your Dart source. It allows you to split up the compiled javascript into smaller chunks and load them only when needed.

This functionality is built into Dart using a concept called [deferred imports](https://dart.dev/language/libraries#lazily-loading-a-library). You can use a deferred import for lazily importing any Dart library, whether it is in your own codebase or from a package.

For example lazy-loading a component could look like this:

```dart
// Use the "deferred as" syntax to specify a deferred import.
import 'components/hello.dart' deferred as hello;

class MyPage extends StatelessComponent {

  Iterable<Component> build(BuildContext context) sync* {
    yield FutureBuilder(
      // This loads in the library when first built.
      future: hello.loadLibrary(),
      builder: (context, snapshot) {
        if (snapshot.hasData) {
          // Show the component only once loaded.
          return hello.Hello();
        } else {
          // Else show a fallback component.
          return Fallback();
        }
      }
    );
  }
}
```

Loading a library like this mostly makes sense if the library is rather complex and would add a significant amount of code to the javascript bundle. Some potential use-cases can be:

- Dialog components that are only loaded when needed.
- A screen that is only shown to a certain group of users and shouldn't slow down the page load for others.
- Business logic for extended user flows that is loaded in as needed.

Checkout the [official documentation](https://dart.dev/language/libraries#lazily-loading-a-library) on deferred imports for more information.

## Other Techniques

There are of course a lot more techniques to improve SEO but are either too specific or too general to cover here. Some honorable mentions are:

- Adding `alt` attributes to all images.
- Optimizing images in size and format (e.g. `.webp`)
- Optimizing fonts.
- Preloading assets using `<link rel="preload">`
