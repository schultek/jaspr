title: Component System
description: An overview of Jasprs component system.

---

**Jaspr** comes with a component system that is very similar to Flutters widgets. This is a core design decision of jaspr, in order to look and feel very familiar to developers coming from Flutter. You might think of it as just replacing the word 'Widget' with 'Component' *(which actually was a small part of jasprs development process ðŸ˜‰)*, while keeping the same structure and behavior.

<Warning>
The following page and other documentation assumes, that you have already a basic understanding of Flutters widget 
system, especially the widget tree and the three base widgets: StatelessWidget, StatefulWidget and InheritedWidget.
</Warning>

When building an app or website with **jaspr** you will mostly use these **three** basic components:

## StatelessComponent

A custom component that does not require any mutable state and looks like this:

```dart
class MyComponent extends StatelessComponent {
  const MyComponent({Key? key}): super(key: key);

  @override
  Component build(BuildContext context) {
    return p([text('Hello World')]);
  }
}
```

Similar to Flutter, this component:

- extends the abstract `StatelessComponent` class,
- has a constructor receiving a `Key` and optionally some custom parameters,
- has a `build()` method receiving a `BuildContext`.

## StatefulComponent

A custom component that has mutable state and looks like this:

```dart
class MyComponent extends StatefulComponent {
  const MyComponent({Key? key}): super(key: key);

  @override
  State createState() => MyComponentState();
}

class MyComponentState extends State<MyComponent> {

  @override
  Component build(BuildContext context) {
    return p([text('Hello World')]);
  }
}
```

Similar to Flutter, this component:

- extends the abstract `StatefulComponent` class,
- has a constructor receiving a `Key` and optionally some custom parameters,
- has a `createState()` method returning an instance of its custom state class

and has an associated state class that:

- extends the abstract `State<T>` class,
- has a `build()` method inside the state class receiving a `BuildContext`,
- can have optional `initState()`, `didChangeDependencies()`, and other lifecycle methods.

## InheritedComponent

A base class for components that efficiently propagate information down the tree and looks like this:

```dart
class MyInheritedComponent extends InheritedComponent {
  const MyInheritedComponent({required super.child, super.key}) ;

  static MyInheritedComponent of(BuildContext context) {
    final MyInheritedComponent? result = context.dependOnInheritedComponentOfExactType<MyInheritedComponent>();
    assert(result != null, 'No MyInheritedComponent found in context');
    return result!;
  }

  @override
  bool updateShouldNotify(covariant MyInheritedComponent oldComponent) {
    return false;
  }
}
```

In every aspect, this component behaves the same as Flutters `InheritedWidget`.
