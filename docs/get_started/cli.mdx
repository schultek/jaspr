# Jaspr CLI
*Create, serve and build projects using the Jaspr CLI.*

---

## Commands

Jaspr comes with a cli tool to create, serve and build your website.

- `jaspr create`: Create a new jaspr project. See [Project Scaffolding](#project-scaffolding)
- `jaspr serve`: Serve the project and automatically refresh when you make changes.
- `jaspr build`: Build the project according to the selected rendering mode.

Additionally, there are the following service commands available:

- `jaspr doctor`: Show information about the environment and current project.
- `jaspr clean`: Delete the `build/` and `.dart_tool/` directories.
- `jaspr update`: Update the jaspr cli.

## Development Server

You can start your Jaspr project in development mode using:

```shell
jaspr serve
```

This will spin up a development server that automatically watches your project files for changes and
rebuild your project.

## Building

When it's time to deploy your application, you can build it using the following command:

```shell
jaspr build
```

This will build the app inside the `build/jaspr/` directory according to your selected [**Rendering Mode**](/get_started/modes):

### Static Mode

Jaspr will start the server entrypoint of your project and pre-render all pages into separate `.html` files.
The pre-rendered pages and all files from `web/` are built to the `build/jaspr/` directory, which you can deploy
to any static hosting provider.

### Server Mode

Jaspr will build a server runnable as well as static assets from `web/`. For the server runnable you can choose whether
to build a standalone executable (default), an aot snapshot or kernel module with the `--target` option.

Your server app will be compiled to `build/jaspr/app<.exe/.aot/.dill>`.
Your static files and assets will be built to the `build/jaspr/web` directory, which must be kept alongside the server
executable during deployment.

### Client Mode

All files are built to the `build/jaspr/` directory, which you can deploy to any static hosting provider.
