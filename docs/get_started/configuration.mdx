title: Project Configuration
description: The configuration options for a Jaspr project.
---

---

Each Jaspr project is a normal Dart project including a `pubspec.yaml` file and `lib/` directory.

The project-wide Jaspr configuration is specified in `pubspec.yaml` under the `jaspr` option:

```yaml
name: my_project
...

jaspr:
  mode: server
  port: 8080
  flutter: plugins
```

There are currently the following configuration options available:

<Property name="mode" type="Enum" required>

  Sets the [**Rendering Mode**](/concepts/modes) for your project. Either `static`, `server` or `client`.
</Property>

---

<Property name="port" type="int" optional>

  *Only applicable in "static" or "server" mode.*

  Specifies the target port to use when **serving** your project. This is optional and defaults to "8080" if not set. Can be overridden by the `--port` flag with `jaspr serve`.
</Property>

---

<Property name="flutter" type="Enum" optional>

  Specifies the Flutter support for your project.

  - `embedded`: Enables [Flutter embedding](/going_further/flutter_embedding) support, allowing you to use Flutter widgets inside Jaspr components.
  - `plugins`: Enables Flutter plugin support, allowing you to use Flutter plugins that provide web support inside your project.
  - `none` or omitted: No Flutter support.

  Using either `embedded` or `plugins` requires the Flutter SDK to be installed and available in your system PATH, as well as a dependency on `build_web_compilers` with a minimum version constraint of `4.4.6` or higher.
</Property>

## Project Structure

The following is the recommended project structure for any Jaspr website. The concrete files vary slightly depending on your chosen [**Rendering Mode**](/concepts/modes).

```markdown
├── lib/
│   ├── components/      // Shared components
│   │   ├── counter.dart
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── pages/           // The pages of your website
│   │   ├── home.dart
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── app.dart         // The main app component, usually containing the Router
│   ├── ...
│   ├── main.client.dart // The client entrypoint, for all modes, optional
│   ├── main.client.options.dart // Auto-generated by Jaspr
│   ├── main.server.dart // The server entrypoint, only for server or static mode
│   └── main.server.optionsdart // Auto-generated by Jaspr
├── web/.                // Static assets
│   ├── images/
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── styles.css       // Usually only for client mode
│   └── index.html       // The index file, only for client mode
├── pubspec.lock
└── pubspec.yaml
```

- The `lib` directory contains all your usual dart code, including components, pages, routes etc.
  depending on your architecture.

- The `lib/main.server.dart` file is the entry point for your **server** application. It calls `runApp()`
  and provides your root document component. Only needed for static or server mode.

  <Info>
    You can also have other `*.server.dart` files and choose one with `--input` flag when running your project.
  </Info>

- The `lib/main.client.dart` file is the entrypoint for your **client** environment. It calls `runApp()` and
  either provides your root component (in client mode), or the `ClientApp()` component (in static or server mode) which
  hydrates all `@client` components.

  <Info>
    You can also have other `*.client.dart` files. Any `*.client.dart` file inside `lib/` is automatically compiled to JavaScript. In static and server mode, any file that has a peer `<filename>.server.dart` file is automatically loaded as a script tag. In client mode, or for using non-peer `*.client.dart` files you need to manually include a script tag pointing to `<filename>.client.dart.js` in your page.
  </Info>

- The `*.<server|client>.options.dart` files are auto-generated by Jaspr's tooling. It exposes a top-level `defaultServerOptions` or `defaultClientOptions` that you should provide to the `Jaspr.initializeApp(options: ...)` call inside `*.<server|client>.dart`.

- The `web` directory contains any static assets you want to access from your website, like images or fonts.
  Files inside this directory are later accessible through their relative url, e.g. `<domain>/images/logo.png`.

- The `web/index.html` file (along with other html and css files) is only needed in client mode and contains the static markup and styling for your website.
