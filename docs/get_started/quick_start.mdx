Welcome to the Jaspr Getting Started guide. In it, you'll install Jaspr, setup a new project and learn the basics of Jaspr.


<Steps>
  
  <Step title="Install Jaspr">

    You can install Jaspr either through our **VSCode Extension** or by installing the **Jaspr CLI** in the terminal. The CLI lets you manage the project from the command line, while the extension provides a more integrated experience within your IDE.

    - <Icon name="cubes" /> Use the Jaspr VSCode Extension to setup and serve your website with full debugging support from inside VSCode.
    - <Icon name="terminal" /> Use the Jaspr CLI to setup and serve your website from the command line.

    <Tabs groupId="tooling">
      <TabItem label="VSCode Extension" value="extension">
        Install the Jaspr VSCode extension by searching for `Jaspr` in the extensions menu.

        After installing and activating the extension, you will get a prompt to install the Jaspr CLI. Accept it to continue.
      </TabItem>
      <TabItem label="Jaspr CLI" value="cli">
        Install the Jaspr CLI via:

        ```js
        dart pub global activate jaspr_cli
        ```

        The `jaspr` command will be available in your terminal.
      </TabItem>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose a Rendering Mode">

    The first thing to do when starting a new project with Jaspr is to decide on a **Rendering Mode** to use. 
    The rendering mode defines how your website is executed and built and each one has it's own advantages and disadvantages based on what you want to build.

    Jaspr supports these three rendering modes:

    <Card title="Static" icon="1">

      In static mode Jaspr performs **static rendering** (also known as Static Site Generation) at build time, generating a fully static site that you can deploy anywhere.

      You can write server-side code to render components and pages, use local or remote data sources, while outputting clean HTML and CSS at build time to deploy anywhere.

      Your client-side code is compiled to JavaScript or Wasm and included in the HTML at build time.

    </Card>
    <Card title="Server" icon="2">

      In server mode Jaspr runs and builds a **server application** that pre-renders your components for each incoming request (also known as Server Side Rendering).

      You can use either Jaspr's inbuilt webserver or choose to integrate it into your favorite Dart backend framework.

      Additionally, you can set up hydration on the client in order to make your site interactive.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Client" icon="3">
      If you want, you can skip the server and pre-rendering part of Jaspr completely and use it as a client-side only framework.

      Similar to static mode, you can deploy your built site to any hosting service without needing an extra server.
    </Card>

    The following table gives a quick comparison of the different modes:

    |                               | **static**         | **server**           | **client** |
    | :---------------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------- | ---------- |
    | **Client-Side Interactivity** | ✅                 | ✅                   | ✅         |
    | **Pre-Rendering**             | ✅ (at build time) | ✅ (at request time) | ❌         |
    | **Pure Dart**                 | ✅                 | ✅                   | ❌         |
    | **Static Deployment**         | ✅                 | ❌                   | ✅         |
    | **Backend Integration**       | ❌                 | ✅                   | ❌         |

  </Step>

  <Step title="Create your Project">

    <Tabs groupId="tooling">
      <TabItem label="VSCode Extension" value="extension">
        To create a new Jaspr project, open the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and select **Jaspr: New Project**. You are ask to choose from several templates and set a project folder.

        ![New Project](https://github.com/schultek/jaspr/blob/main/modules/jaspr-code/media/screenshots/new_project.png?raw=true)

        The first three templates are the default choices for each rendering mode: static, server and client. The fourth option includes an embedded Flutter web app and the fifth comes with a custom backend setup using `shelf`.

        <Info>
          Choosing a template will not lock you into a specific configuration. Starting from one template you can easily modify your code to behave as any other template along the way.
        </Info>
      </TabItem>
      <TabItem label="Jaspr CLI" value="cli">
        To create a new project run:

        ```
        jaspr create my_website
        ```

        This will walk you through the setup wizard and create a new Jaspr project inside the `my_website` folder.

        The cli will prompt you with a set of options to configure your project. You can read about what each option does below or just start with the recommended ones (simply press **Enter** each time).

        <Accordion title="Click me to see all options">
          You can configure the following options:

          <Property name="Rendering Mode">
            Select one of the three rendering modes Jaspr supports.
          </Property>

          ---

          <Property name="Routing">
            Whether to set up routing. Selecting **Yes** will setup a basic `Routing` with two routes ('/home' and '/about'). This gives you a convenient starting point when you plan to develop a website with multiple pages.
          </Property>

          ---

          <Property name="Multi-Page Routing" type="conditional">
            Whether to set up multi-page or single-page routing, also called server-side or client-side routing respectively. This defined how navigating
            between routes will behave. Either a "real" page load is performed when navigating to a new route (aka. the browser requests the new page using its url from the server).
            Or the routing happens purely on the client without any request to the server.

            <Info>
                There are different advantages and disadvantages for both types. To help you decide you can find many [articles](https://www.google.com/search?q=multi+page+vs+single+page+site) about this topic.
            </Info>

            Read more about routing [here](/concepts/routing).
          </Property>

          ---

          <Property name="Flutter Embedding">
            Whether to setup an embedded Flutter application with your site. This will use Jaspr's first-party integration for [Flutter element embedding](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/web#embedding-a-flutter-app-into-an-html-page) and create a simple Flutter counter app that synchronizes its state with your Jaspr site.
          </Property>

          ---

          <Property name="Plugin Support">
            Whether to enable support for Flutter web plugins. This will switch to Jaspr's custom compiler pipeline (replacing `build_web_compilers`) which allows the use of most Flutter web plugins in your Jaspr site without any additional setup.
            *Flutter web plugins* refers to any Flutter plugin from pub.dev that supports web and is not concerned with widgets or rendering. This includes packages like `shared_preferences` or `firebase`.
          </Property>

          ---

          <Property name="Custom Backend" type="conditional">
            Whether to use a custom backend package or framework for the server part of your project. You can choose between:
            - **None**: No backend setup. This is the default option and is recommended if you are just starting out.
            - **Shelf**: A simple and lightweight web server for Dart. This is a good choice if you want to build a custom backend for your project.
            - *More options coming soon*

            Read more about backends [here](/going_further/backend).
          </Property>
        </Accordion>

        Alternatively, you can select a pre-made template using the `--template` option.

        <Info>
            Choosing a set of options do not lock you into a specific configuration. Starting from one setup you can easily modify your code to behave as any other setup along the way.

  <Step title="Run your Project">
    <Tabs groupId="tooling">
      <TabItem label="VSCode Extension" value="extension">
        To run and debug a Jaspr applications, launch it using F5 or the Debug menu. The extension will start the debug process and attach the Dart debugger to it. 

        ---

        When developing a Jaspr project in `static` or `server` mode, this will open **two** separate debugging sessions, one for the server and one for the client. Switch between the two using the debugging sidebar or process dropdown.

        | Sidebar | Dropdown. |
        |---|---|
        | ![Sidebar](https://github.com/schultek/jaspr/blob/main/modules/jaspr-code/media/screenshots/sidebar.png?raw=true) | ![Dropdown](https://github.com/schultek/jaspr/blob/main/modules/jaspr-code/media/screenshots/dropdown.png?raw=true)

        Both processes will be managed by the main Jaspr terminal.

        ![Terminal](https://github.com/schultek/jaspr/blob/main/modules/jaspr-code/media/screenshots/terminal.png?raw=true)

        To stop the server, click "Stop Jaspr" in the status bar, or focus the terminal and press `Ctrl+C`. This will stop both debugging sessions and the main process.
        You can also detach the debugging sessions individually using the detach button in the debug bar, but this will keep the app running.
      </TabItem>
      <TabItem label="Jaspr CLI" value="cli">
        Start the development server via:

        ```shell
        cd my_website
        jaspr serve
        ```

        This will spin up a development server at `localhost:8080`.
      </TabItem>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Next Steps">
    You can now start developing your website. 🎉

    <Success>
      Observe that the browser automatically refreshes the page when you change something in your code, like the `Welcome` text.
