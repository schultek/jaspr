## State-Management Packages

Jasprs component system is conceptually and implementation-wise very close to Flutters 
widget system. This makes it rather easy to port popular Flutter state-management packages to Jaspr.

As an example, Jaspr has its own official port of `flutter_riverpod`:

- [`jaspr_riverpod`](/eco/riverpod).

From the community, there also exists ports for:

- [jaspr_provider](https://pub.dev/packages/jaspr_provider)
- [jaspr_bloc](https://github.com/f-person/jaspr_bloc) (not published)

## CSS Frameworks

Since Jaspr works with native web technology and css, it is possible to build dart wrappers around
css frameworks that expose Jaspr components.

There currently exist no such published package, but some resources include:

- [Bulma Sample for JasprPad](https://playground.jaspr.site/?sample=bulma)
- [DaisyUI Tutorial](https://dinkomarinac.dev/styling-your-dart-jaspr-website-with-tailwind-css-and-daisyui)

## UI Component Libraries

There are currently no existing ui component libraries for Jaspr. Feel free to create one. ðŸ’™
