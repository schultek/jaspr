# Riverpod Example

This example shows how to use Riverpod with Jaspr. 

## Overview

The project uses the `jaspr_riverpod` package and displays a basic counter component.

It leverages jasprs server-side rendering capabilities to get the initial count on the server and
prerender the app with that count. The client will then start on the value set by the server.
